    { name: 'Bless', level: 1, page: 92, duration: 'Instantaneous', range: 'Touch', description: 'This spell bestows the favor of the Cleric\'s deity upon the subject. That subject receives a number of points (1d6 + caster\'s level) to allocate to any future die rolls—To-Hit, saving throws, skill checks, surprise checks, whatever the subject desires—except damage rolls. The subject trades the points on a one-for-one basis and can adjust the roll by that many points however he sees fit. The number of points to be used on a roll must be declared before the roll is made. All unused points are lost at dawn the following day. <br/><br/>No rolls relating to damage or anything concerning the use of magic use can be modified by Bless. Elves and other intrinsically magical creatures cannot benefit from Bless.' },
    { name: 'Command', level: 1, page: 95, duration: '1 Round', range: '10\'', description: 'When a Cleric casts this spell, he can give the subject a single word command, which it obeys to the best of its ability. The single word must make sense as a single command, such as approach, drop, fall, flee, halt, surrender, sleep, etc. Although a target could be instructed to die, this will only make the target collapse into a comatose state for a single Round. Note that the caster must be able to speak the language of the target. Any intended target that has more than 5 levels or Hit Dice, or an Intelligence of over 12 is entitled to a saving throw versus Magic. This spell is ineffective against undead.' },

For example, if the caster is 5th level, the spell restores 1d6+5 Hit Points. <br/><br/>The spell can also be used to remove one temporary negative condition instead of restoring lost Hit Points. For example, if a character is paralyzed, stunned, or blinded for a set period of time, then this spell will remove any of these conditions. It will not work on permanent conditions, and only one condition (or damage) can be treated per casting of the spell. <br/><br/>Recipients of the spell can only be restored to their normal maximum Hit Points, and no more. Any excess restored points are lost. The reverse of the spell can only be used to inflict points of damage.' },
    { name: 'Detect Evil', level: 1, page: 99, duration: 'Instantaneous', range: 'Line of Sight', description: '“Evil,” for purposes of this spell, is an in-game colloquial term. It should properly be called “Detect Chaos.” <br/><br/>This spell allows the caster to know if anything that is within his field of vision (or on his person) is Chaotic. For the purposes of this spell, Chaotic is defined as, but not limited to, undead creatures, any extra-dimensional or extra-planar creatures that are not specifically Powers of Law or angels, any creature with innate magical abilities (including Magic-Users, but not Clerics), artifacts, symbols, or sacred places dedicated to evil gods, and supernatural creatures incapable of being good. <br/><br/>Mortal creatures, physical objects not directly connected to evil deities, traps, poison, or places where great atrocities have taken place are not considered Chaotic or evil for the purposes of this spell. It detects supernatural disturbances, not ill intent or foul deeds. <br/><br/>Curiously, this spell does not detect magical items or effects. <br/><br/>The reverse of this spell, Detect Good, detects Law instead of Chaos.' },
    { name: 'Invisibility to Undead', level: 1, page: 112, duration: '1 Turn/level', range: 'Touch', description: 'The subject of this spell becomes completely unnoticed by undead creatures for the duration of the spell. Undead creatures cannot see, hear, or smell the subject at all for the duration of the spell or until the subject does something to intentionally gain an undead creature’s attention (including attacking). This breaks the spell completely, with all undead in the area being then able to sense the subject. <br/><br/>The reverse of this spell, Undead Attraction, causes all present undead to ignore all living beings other than the subject until the subject is dead or until one of the ignored beings attacks the undead.' },

It should properly be called “Protection from Chaos.” <br/><br/>The subject of this spell becomes more resistant to Chaotic creatures and effects. Any Chaotic creature suffers a penalty to hit the subject in mêlée combat equal to the level of the caster, and the subject gets a +1 bonus per level of the caster to save against any attack or effect caused by a Chaotic creature. Protection from Evil also allows a saving throw against Magic-User spells and effects against the subject which normally do not grant saves (spells which deliver damage do half on a successful save, other spells fail entirely on a successful save), but the subject must also save against the effects of the beneficial spells he wants to be cast on him. <br/><br/>See book for details.' },
    { name: 'Purify Food and Drink', level: 1, page: 125, duration: 'Instantaneous', range: '30\'', description: 'Enough food and water for up to a dozen people is made pure, removing all spoilage and poisons. The reverse of the spell, Foul Food and Drink, contaminates food and water and will spoil holy water.' },
    { name: 'Remove Fear', level: 1, page: 126, duration: 'See Below', range: 'Touch', description: 'This spells instills courage in the subject, and potentially removes the effect of magic-induced fear by allowing the target a saving throw versus Magic to attempt to remove the effects. The subject receives a saving throw bonus of +1 per level of the caster. The subject automatically succeeds in any morale checks for a number of Rounds equal to the caster’s level. Remove Fear counters and dispels Cause Fear. The reverse, Cause Fear, will cause a subject who is touched to run away, hysterical, at full running movement for a number of Rounds equal to the caster’s level.' },
    { name: 'Sanctuary', level: 1, page: 127, duration: '2 Rounds/level', range: 'Touch', description: 'This spell allows the subject to be attacked less often by foes. Any creature attempting to attack the subject must first make a saving throw versus Magic, or else it is not permitted to make an attack. The attacker does not lose its turn; it can still attack another target, move, or do anything else it is normally allowed to do. This restriction applies to area effect attacks as well, unless there is another target within that area. The spell ends immediately if the subject makes any violent or offensive action.' },
    { name: 'Turn Undead', level: 1, page: 146, duration: '1d4+2 Turns', range: '120\'', description: 'One true measure of divine power is the command over life and death. In particular, power over the walking dead. They are abominations, a crime against creation. One of a Cleric’s first duties is to ensure that the dead shall dead remain. And so they have the power to first ward against, and later outright destroy, these creations. <br/><br/>See book for details.' },
    // Level 2
    { name: 'Augury', level: 2, page: 91, duration: 'Instantaneous', range: '0', description: 'This spell allows the caster to see a vision of all timelines, possibilities, and probabilities for but a moment, allowing him the chance to determine whether a particular action will bring weal or woe. Because the caster is afforded only a glimpse of the possibilities, and because he does not know all the forces at work at any particular time, the vision can be misinterpreted. <br/><br/>The base chance for deciphering a true answer is 70% + 1% per caster level. This roll is made secretly. The Augury can see into the future only 3 Turns, so anything that might happen after that does not affect the result. Thus, the result will not take into account the long-term consequences of a contemplated action. <br/><br/>If there is a reward for a particular action, but no risk, the answer is “weal.” If a certain action will bring the caster closer to a stated goal, the answer is “weal.” If there is a reward for a particular action, but risk involved, the answer is “weal.” Risk, but no reward is “woe.” Reward, but with overwhelming risk is “woe.” An action that leads the caster further away from a stated goal is “woe.” The Referee must judge all outcomes to determine the correct answer. If there is no clear answer, then there is a flat 50% chance of either “weal” or “woe.” These answers are for successful rolls as noted above, and a failed roll will always give the opposite answer.' },
    { name: 'Delay Poison', level: 2, page: 99, duration: 'Instantaneous', range: 'Touch', description: 'This spell counteracts the work of poison already done, weakening it, giving its victim a new chance at life. Any character that has succumbed to poison within the previous 24 hours can immediately make a new saving throw versus Poison to resist its effects when this spell is cast.' },
    { name: 'Enthrall', level: 2, page: 102, duration: 'See Below', range: '100\'', description: 'When one’s voice is given divine authority, it will be listened to. This spell allows the Cleric to hold the attention of a crowd and possibly to influence that crowd. Any non-hostile beings within 100\' will stop what they are doing to listen to the Cleric speak. <br/><br/>The Cleric can compel a crowd to action. If the Cleric attempts to persuade the crowd to do something that they are already inclined to do, they will act if they fail a saving throw versus Magic (just because they want to do something, it does not necessarily make it a good idea, otherwise they would already have done it). If the Cleric attempts to persuade the crowd to do something that offends their sensibilities, they will attack the Cleric if they fail their saving throw. <br/><br/>The spell ends immediately if any of the subjects of the spell are attacked or harmed in any way, if there is a powerful distraction that breaks the crowd\'s attention, or if the Cleric stops speaking to them.' },
    { name: 'Heat Metal', level: 2, page: 108, duration: '7 Rounds', range: '40\'', description: 'Those who would dare take up arms against the gods\' chosen shall burn. This spell targets one opponent and causes all metal arms and armor (including impromptu weapons!) to become hot enough to burn flesh. As insurance against hypocrisy, the caster\'s arms and armor heats up as well. <br/><br/>On the first Round of the spell, the metal becomes warm and uncomfortable to touch, but deals no damage. The same effect also occurs on the last Round of the spell\'s duration. During the second (and also the next-to-last) Round, intense heat causes pain and damage. In the third, fourth, and fifth Rounds, the metal is searing hot, causing more damage. <br/><br/>See book for details' },
    { name: 'Heroism', level: 2, page: 108, duration: '1 Round/level', range: 'Touch', description: 'This spell grants the subject 1d4 levels’ worth of Hit Points and saving throws (and, for Fighters, Attack Bonus) for the duration of the spell. When the spell ends, if the subject has more Hit Points than when the spell was cast, his Hit Points return to their previous level. If the subject has less than or equal the number of Hit Points, then there is no adjustment once the spell ends.' },
    { name: 'Resist Cold', level: 2, page: 126, duration: '1 Turn/level', range: 'Touch', description: 'While under the effects of this spell, a character or monster is unharmed by freezing (non-magical) cold, and receives a bonus of +2 to all saving throws versus cold-based magical or breath attacks. In addition, 1 point of damage is subtracted from each dice of damage dealt by a cold-based attack. Each die will still inflict a minimum of 1 point of damage.' },
    { name: 'Resist Fire', level: 2, page: 126, duration: '1 Turn/level', range: 'Touch', description: 'While under the effects of this spell, a character or monster is unharmed by intense (non-magical) heat, and he receives a bonus of +3 to all saving throws versus heat-based magical or breath attacks. In addition, 1 point of damage is subtracted from each die of damage dealt by a heat-based attack. Each die will still inflict a minimum of 1 point of damage.' },
    { name: 'Silence 15\' Radius', level: 2, page: 129, duration: '2 Rounds/level', range: '120\'', description: 'Upon the casting of this spell, complete silence prevails in a diameter of 30\'. All sound is stopped and conversation is impossible. No noise whatsoever issues from the area, but noise originating from outside the silenced area can be heard by those within it. The spell can be cast on a point in space, but the effect is stationary unless cast on a mobile object. The spell can be centered on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. An unwilling creature can attempt a saving throw versus Magic, and if successful the spell takes effect in a stationary location near the creature, but the creature can move out of the affected area.' },
    // Level 3
    { name: 'Cure Disease', level: 3, page: 98, duration: 'Instantaneous', range: 'Touch', description: 'Through the mercy of divine powers, this spell allows a Cleric to cast out the sin and degeneracy in a person that allows evil spirits to invade his body and misalign his humors. Yet because man (and demi-human) is a naturally immoral and spiritually disgusting creature, the subject of the spell must make a saving throw versus Magic in order for the spell to be effective. <br/><br/>A successful casting instantly cures all diseases, including mummy rot and lycanthropy. If used against oozes or slimes, they do not receive a saving throw and suffer 1d6 damage per level of the caster (the cleric suffers an attack’s worth of damage when touching the slime with this attack). <br/><br/>Cause Disease (the reverse of Cure Disease) inflicts a terrible withering disease on a victim, which will cause death in 2d12 days. A saving throw versus Magic is allowed. This disease can be cured with the casting of Cure Disease. The victim of this disease cannot be cured of damage from other spells, and it takes twice the time for normal healing. This suffering further results in a penalty of –2 to hit rolls made by the victim.' },
    { name: 'Dispel Magic', level: 3, page: 100, duration: 'Instantaneous', range: '120\'', description: 'Magic is unnatural and unwanted in the intended order of things. This spell empowers the proper forces of existence to expel the foul energies known as magic as if they never were. The spell affects a 20\' cubic area. All spells in that area that are currently in effect are automatically negated. If cast on the same Segment in combat as a spell from an enemy combatant, Dispel Magic can be used to disrupt and negate that spell. <br/><br/>Monsters with magical ability or able to create magical effects (including Elves, but not Magic- Users) lose the ability to use these powers for 2d6 Turns if they are within the area of effect and fail a saving throw versus Magic. <br/><br/>All magical items within the area of effect are temporarily disenchanted. They regain their enchantment after 2d6 Turns. If the caster casts Dispel Magic as a touch effect, then any item so touched is permanently disenchanted. Dispel Magic negates magical curses or diseases for 2d6 Turns only.' },
    { name: 'Magic Vestment', level: 3, page: 115, duration: '1 Turn/level', range: 'Touch', description: 'This spell shields the subject by the power of faith, granting them a +1 Armor Class for every level of the caster. This spell does not function if the subject is wearing armor or using any sort of protective enchantments or items.' },
    { name: 'Remove Curse', level: 3, page: 126, duration: 'Instantaneous', range: 'Touch', description: 'Remove Curse instantaneously removes one curse on a creature if it makes a saving throw versus Magic. Remove Curse does not remove the curse from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, although the spell enables the creature afflicted with any such cursed item to remove it from his person and get rid of it. Remove Curse counters and dispels Bestow Curse. <br/><br/>Bestow Curse (the reverse of Remove Curse) can bring about any number of unfortunate effects upon a being, determined by the caster and Referee. Some limits of effect must be enforced. Typical possibilities are limited to no more than a –2 penalty to saving throws or –4 to hit, an ability being reduced by 50%. These effects can have any number of creative symptoms. The victim can avoid being affected by Bestow Curse with a successful saving throw versus Magic.' },
    { name: 'Sacrifice', level: 3, page: 127, duration: 'Instantaneous', range: 'Touch', description: 'This spell allows the Cleric to transfer any desired number of Hit Points from himself to the target. The reverse of this spell, Drain Life, allows the caster to drain 1d6+1 Hit Points from a creature, with a successful attack roll. The Hit Points are transferred to the cleric through healing.' },
    { name: 'Water Walk', level: 3, page: 150, duration: '1 Turn/level', range: 'Touch', description: 'The subject of this spell is granted divine favor, allowing him to walk on water, or any kind of liquid, as if it were dry land. However, liquid is similarly impenetrable to the subject as normal ground, so it would be impossible to reach into a pool of water to grab anything, for example. If the liquid is dangerous (lava, acid), the subject is still subject to negative effects of the substance. The subject can end the spell at any time.' },
    // Level 4
    { name: 'Cure Serious Wounds', level: 4, page: 98, duration: 'Instantaneous', range: 'Touch', description: 'By the power of the Cleric’s faith and the strength of the life force of the wounded character, this spell restores 1d6 Hit Points to one damaged character, plus a number of points equal to the level of the caster, plus a number of points equal to the level of the subject. For example, if the caster is 10th level and the character being healed is 5th level, the spell restores 1d6+15 Hit Points. <br/><br/>The spell can also be used to remove one temporary negative condition instead of restoring lost Hit Points. For example, if a character is paralyzed, stunned, or blinded for a set period of time, then this spell will remove any of these conditions. It will not work on permanent conditions, and only one condition (or damage) can be treated per casting of the spell. <br/><br/>Recipients of the spell can only be restored to their normal maximum Hit Points, and no more. Any excess restored points are lost. The reverse of the spell can only be used to inflict points of damage.' },
    { name: 'Detect Lie', level: 4, page: 99, duration: 'Instantaneous', range: '0', description: 'This spell allows the caster to determine if any one statement made to him in the past hour was the truth or a lie. Honest mistakes are not detected as lies, nor are untrue statements made by charmed or bewitched individuals, for they know not what they say.' },
    { name: 'Divination', level: 4, page: 101, duration: 'Instantaneous', range: '0', description: 'The Divine powers know everything that was, everything that is, and everything that will be. This spell allows the Cleric to distract his god with his resplendent devotion and allow some of the god’s knowledge to slip into the world. The Cleric can then interpret those memories to gain information regarding an area, building, area of a dungeon, or other similar place. <br/><br/>Information gained includes, in vague terms, a general idea of how powerful the creatures are there present, the general amount of treasure present, what kind of resistance to attack is present, and the nature of it, whether it is good, evil, chaotic, lawful, etc. The base chance for a correct divination is 60%+1% per caster level. The Referee should roll this secretly. If the dice roll fails, false information is delivered.' },
    { name: 'Neutralize Poison', level: 4, page: 117, duration: 'Instantaneous', range: 'Touch', description: 'The caster removes all trace of venom and poison in the creature or object touched. A poisoned creature suffers no additional effects from the poison, and any temporary effects are ended. The spell does not reverse instantaneous effects such as Hit Point damage, or other effects that do not go away on their own. If a character dies of poison, Neutralize Poison will revive the character if the spell is used no more than one Turn after death. <br/><br/>The reverse of this spell, Inflict Poison, gives the caster a poison touch, and the first victim touched by the Cleric must save versus Poison or die.' },
    { name: 'Protection from Evil, 10\' Radius', level: 4, page: 124, duration: '1 Round/level', range: '0', description: '“Evil,” for purposes of this spell, is an in-game colloquial term. It should properly be called “Protection from Chaos, 10\' Radius.” <br/><br/>This spell creates a zone of protection 10\' in radius, centered on and moving with the caster. Everyone within this zone becomes more resistant to Chaotic creatures and effects. Any Chaotic creature suffers a penalty to hit the subject in mêlée combat equal to the level of the caster, and the subject gets a +1 bonus per level of the caster to save against any attack or effect caused by a Chaotic creature. Protection from Evil also allows a saving throw against Magic-User spells and effects against the subject which normally do not grant saves (spells which deliver damage do half on a successful save, other spells fail entirely on a successful save), but the subject must also save against the effects of the beneficial spells he wants to be cast on him. <br/><br/>See book for details.' },
    { name: 'Spell Immunity', level: 4, page: 131, duration: '1 Turn/level', range: 'Touch', description: 'The caster can use this spell to grant resistance to all spells and spell-like abilities, improving his chance to make saves versus Magic. Spells that Charm, Command, Cause Fear, and similar effects are granted a saving throw bonus of +8. Extremely powerful compulsive spells such as Geas are granted a bonus to a saving throw of +5. All other spells are granted a +3 saving throw bonus. The caster can affect 1 creature for the spell\'s duration, per level, or multiple creatures with the duration divided among them.' },
    // Level 5
    { name: 'Commune', level: 5, page: 95, duration: 'See Below', range: '0', description: 'By entering into deep meditation, the Cleric’s spirit momentarily ascends to its final reward for a glimpse of the afterlife for the devout believer. If the Referee judges that the Cleric has not been faithful to his religion, the Cleric must make a saving throw versus Magic (Wisdom modifiers apply). If the roll fails, then the Cleric finds himself in the afterlife reserved for heretics and apostates—more horrible than any other punishment reserved for mortal souls. The spell will have no benefit, and the Cleric will effectively age 1d10 years from the experience as the soul returns to the body, ending the spell. <br/><br/>If the Cleric has been at the very least reasonably devout, or succeeds in the saving throw, the caster experiences the afterlife reserved for the most blessed of his faith, the ultimate paradise. In this place, all time and all knowledge are one. The Cleric’s player can ask three questions that can be answered “yes” or “no,” representing the Cleric’s efforts to see specific events within the All, and the Referee must answer each question truthfully. <br/><br/>If the spell is cast more than once a week and the Cleric is not sufficiently devout, the saving throw to prevent a glimpse of eternal damnation is made at a –1 penalty, cumulative per number of times the spell is cast. If the Cleric is devout, he must make a saving throw versus Magic (Wisdom modifiers apply inversely; a high Wisdom makes this saving throw more difficult), with a –1 cumulative penalty every additional time a week the spell is cast, or else the overwhelming joy and vindication of his beliefs is too strong and he will not return from paradise.' },

Should the affected character resist taking on the quest, he will be under the effect of a curse, the nature of which is decided by the Referee. The only way to remove the curse is to undertake the quest, and when the quest is finished the spell terminates.' },

The spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction that will eventually lead it to its destination, indicating, at appropriate times, the exact path to follow or physical actions to take. The spell ends when the destination is reached, or the duration expires, whichever comes first. Find the Path can be used to remove the subject from the effect of a Maze spell in a single Round. <br/><br/>Lose the Path (the reverse of Find the Path) renders a touched being completely incapable of finding its way.' },

Control Weather can do away with atmospheric phenomena (naturally occurring or otherwise) as well as create them. <br/><br/>If the weather is completely foreign to the area, the spell’s duration is cut in half.' },
    { name: 'Earthquake', level: 7, page: 102, duration: 'Instantaneous', range: '120\'', description: 'The wrath of divine power is a terrible thing to behold, and this spell allows the Cleric to command this wrath and unleash it against his enemies! An intense, but highly localized tremor rips the ground, to a diameter of 5\' per caster level. The shock collapses structures, opens cracks in the ground, and more. The effect lasts for 1 Round, during which time creatures on the ground cannot move, cast spells, or attack. The earthquake affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area. The specific effect of an earthquake spell depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast. <br/><br/>See book for details' },
    { name: 'Holy Word', level: 7, page: 109, duration: 'See Below', range: '0', description: 'The language of gods is not one for mortal ears. In fact, it is the speaking of these words that is behind the power of Clerical magic. Some words though, are more devastating than others. The most destructive word is the true name of the Cleric’s god, spoken as the god would speak it. The intonation of this Holy Word utterly banishes creatures not native to the caster’s plane, hurling them back to their respective planes of existence. Additionally, other creatures will suffer effects from the Holy Word in accordance with the creature’s Hit Dice. <br/><br/>See book for details' },

The caster can dismiss the spell effects before the duration ends, thus allowing water to crash down upon unwanted pursuers.' }

    { name: 'Bookspeak', level: 1, page: 92, duration: '1 Round/level', range: 'Touch', description: 'When the subject of this spell touches a book, it animates, forming a mouth around the edge where the paper shows. The subject can ask the book one question per Round, and if the information is contained within the book, it will answer. If anyone else approaches or asks questions the book snaps and growls that Round instead of answering a question. Intelligent books can save to resist the spell (as a Magic-User of a level equal to the author). Magical books do not impart their effect when they answer. The spell is a shortcut to actually reading a book, and it will not give more information than a careful reading would.' },
    { name: 'Charm Person', level: 1, page: 93, duration: 'See Below', range: '120\'', description: 'The Charm Person spell makes a single subject utterly enamored with the caster and desperate to please him if the saving throw versus Magic is failed. This is not mind control, as the subject retains his personality and controls how he acts but for his utter fascination with the caster. The caster must articulate his desires if he expects the subject to fulfill them. <br/><br/>Any request which is not against the subject’s interests or personality will be followed. Any request which is against the subject’s interests or personality triggers a saving throw to refuse the request. If the saving throw is successful, the request will be refused, but this will not break the Charm. If as part of a request, the caster promises the subject something that the subject is normally inclined to want, then this saving throw is not necessary, and the subject will comply. <br/><br/>This spell works on all humans and human-like creatures (except Elves); other (non player character class) humanoids are not affected if they have more than four Hit Dice. Abuse or neglect of the subject will trigger another saving throw to negate the Charm, and murderous violence towards the subject also triggers a save, but with a +5 bonus to the roll. The subject, if intelligent, will realize that he has been victim to mesmerism, and retain full memory of his actions while under the Charm after the spell ends.' },
    { name: 'Comprehend Languages', level: 1, page: 95, duration: '1 Turn/level', range: '0', description: 'The caster can understand the spoken words of creatures or read otherwise incomprehensible written messages by summoning the spirits of the all-knowing dead to translate for him. The creature or the writing must be touched by the caster before the spirits can deliver any translation. The ability to read does not necessarily impart insight into the material, merely its literal meaning. The spell enables the caster to understand or read an unknown language, not speak or write it. <br/><br/>Obscure Languages, the opposite of Comprehend Languages, dispels the effects of Comprehend Languages, or can be used to make spoken or written language incomprehensible by summoning spirits to possess the lips of a speaker, or the eyes of a reader, ruining all chances of communication.' },
    { name: 'Detect Magic', level: 1, page: 100, duration: 'Instantaneous', range: 'Line of Sight', description: 'This spell allows the caster to know if anything within his field of vision (or on his person) is in any way magical. This includes magical creatures, magical items, or any creature or object under the effect of an ongoing spell. Spellcasters such as Magic-Users and Elves do not detect as magic with this spell, but anyone that is under the effects of an active spell does. <br/><br/>The spell does not identify the nature of the magic, only that magic is present. The caster must already be able to see the object in question in order to detect it as magical. Concealed, covered, or invisible objects will not be revealed by this spell.' },
    { name: 'Enlarge', level: 1, page: 102, duration: '1 Turn/level', range: '5\'/level', description: 'The forces of magic do not recognize the relationships of size and distance between things; it is the limitations of the mind’s ability to master magic that results in strictures such as “spell range,” but sometimes the infinite nature of magic can be applied to material objects. This spell causes instant growth (and corresponding increase in weight and damage done) of a single object or creature that is in visible range. This increase changes a creature’s size by 20% per caster level, up to three times the original size of the creature. The effectiveness of this spell is half of this on non-living objects, which are only enlarged 10% per level and to a maximum of double the original size of the object. The caster can affect a 10\' cube of living matter per level or a 5\' cube per level of non-living matter. <br/><br/>See book for details' },

Outlined subjects shed light that makes them visible in darkness at a distance of 80\', or half this if the creatures are near a light source. The Magic-User can affect creatures within a 40\' radius, and may outline up to one human-sized creature per caster level. The Faerie Fire can be blue, green, or violet, according to the Magic-User’s choice at the time of casting. The Faerie Fire does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined. However, their greater visibility grants attackers a +2 bonus to hit them while the spell is in effect.' },
    { name: 'Feather Fall', level: 1, page: 104, duration: 'See Below', range: '10\'/level', description: 'The affected creatures or objects in range fall slowly. Feather Fall instantly changes the rate at which the targets fall to that of a feather (about 5\' per Round), and the subjects take no damage upon landing while the spell is in effect. The spell ends immediately when the subject stops falling. <br/><br/>The spell can affect one or more objects or creatures, including gear and carried objects up to each creature’s maximum encumbrance. The maximum volume is a 10\' cube, and 200 pounds + 200 pounds per level can also be affected, such that a 1st level Magic-User can affect 400 pounds. <br/><br/>The spell can be cast with an instant utterance, quickly enough to save the caster or another creature if he unexpectedly falls, but Initiative, if appropriate, must be on the side of the caster. The spell can be cast on falling items or creatures and missiles, but is ineffective against creatures firmly on the ground or flying. No saving throw is permitted.' },
    { name: 'Floating Disc', level: 1, page: 105, duration: '6 Turns', range: '20\'', description: 'The caster creates a slightly concave, circular plane of force that follows him about and carries a heavy load for him. The disk is 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch deep at its center. It can hold 500 pounds. If used to transport a liquid, its capacity is 2 gallons. The disk floats approximately 3 feet above the ground at all times and remains level. It floats along horizontally within spell range and will accompany the caster with an equal movement rate. If not otherwise directed, it maintains a constant interval of 6\' between itself and the caster, and will follow the caster without prompting to maintain a minimum of 6\' distance. When the disk winks out at the end of the spell’s duration, whatever it was supporting falls to the surface beneath it.' },
    { name: 'Hold Portal', level: 1, page: 109, duration: '2d6 Turns', range: '10\'', description: 'This spell magically holds shut a door, gate, window, or shutter of wood, metal, or stone.

    { name: 'Identify', level: 1, page: 110, duration: 'Instantaneous', range: 'Touch', description: 'This spell allows the Magic-User to discern the magical properties of an item. The spell requires one uninterrupted day in a laboratory worth at least 1,000 sp to cast. At the end of the day, the Magic- User will have successfully determined one magical property of an item. The character will not know if there are additional properties unless he casts Identify again and another magical property of the item is determined. He will only know all of the magical properties of an item when he casts the spell and no new property is identified; both the “wasted” day and the “wasted” casting of Identify confirming that the item has no further properties. Note that a cursed item will not be identified as cursed, but as the item it pretends to be. This spell does not reveal command words. Each casting of the spell, successful or not, requires the expenditure of 100 sp worth of ingredients.' },
    { name: 'Light', level: 1, page: 113, duration: '3 Turns/caster level', range: '120\'', description: 'This spell creates a light source equivalent to that of a torch in the target area of the spell. The effect is immobile if cast on an area, but if cast on an object it moves with the object. Once cast, the caster has no control over the light, but can end the spell if he so wishes. If cast on a person or on the equipment of a person who does not wish to be the target of the spell, that person is allowed a saving throw versus Magic; success means that the spell is cast on the area the person is in, but not on a particular object. <br/><br/>The light caused by the spell emits no heat, nor can it be extinguished by water or high winds. The source of the light can be covered, which will block the light, but this will not end the spell. <br/><br/>Darkness, the reverse of the spell causes an area to be covered in total darkness; even creatures able to see in the dark are blind here. <br/><br/>The spell can be targeted at a creature’s eyes specifically to blind it, assuming it has eyes in close proximity to one another. The target gets a saving throw versus Magic. If successful, the spell fails to work at all.' },
    { name: 'Magic Aura', level: 1, page: 114, duration: 'Permanent', range: 'Touch', description: 'This spell makes an object appealing to the microcosmic forces of magic, giving the item an aura that causes it to register to Detect spells (and spells with similar capabilities) as though it were magical. If the object bearing Magic Aura is physically examined (touched), the examiner recognizes that the aura is false if he succeeds in a saving throw versus Magic. Otherwise, he believes the aura, but no amount of testing reveals what the true magic is. <br/><br/>The reverse of this spell, Obscure Aura, hides the magic aura of a legitimate magical item. A Magic- User casting Detect Magic and actually handling the item is permitted a saving throw versus Magic to see the magical aura of the item.' },
    { name: 'Magic Missile', level: 1, page: 115, duration: 'Instantaneous', range: '60\' + 10\'/level', description: 'A missile of magical energy shoots forth from the caster’s fingertip and strikes its target, dealing damage equal to 1d4 per level of the caster (so a second level Magic-User deals 2d4 points of damage). The missile strikes unerringly, even if the target is in mêlée combat or has less than total cover or total concealment. Specific parts of a creature cannot be singled out. <br/><br/>The caster can throw the full force of the missile at a single target, but if the caster is 2nd level or higher, he can choose to divide the dice of damage between targets as he wishes. Dice must be assigned to targets before any damage is rolled, and targets of these divided dice are allowed a saving throw versus Magic, with success meaning that the target takes half damage. <br/><br/>Each Magic-User’s Magic Missile is unique in appearance and always looks the same. When the caster writes a scroll, the resulting Missile looks identical to the normally cast version. When using a scroll written by another Magic-User, or memorizing a spell out of another’s spellbook, the resulting spell will look like that other caster’s Missile. Each different ‘signature’ for a Magic Missile must be researched and/or transcribed as if it were a different spell.' },
    { name: 'Mending', level: 1, page: 116, duration: 'Instantaneous', range: '30\'', description: 'Mending repairs small breaks or tears in objects. It will weld broken metallic objects such as a ring, a chain link, a medallion, or a slender dagger, providing but one break exists. Ceramic or wooden objects with multiple breaks can be invisibly rejoined to be as strong as new. A hole in a leather sack or a wineskin is completely healed over by Mending. The spell cannot repair magic items, nor does it affect creatures.' },
    { name: 'Message', level: 1, page: 116, duration: 'Instantaneous', range: '60\' + 10\'/level', description: 'This spell grants the caster the ability to whisper messages and receive whispered replies. The caster points his finger at a creature he wants to receive the message. The target must be in direct line of sight, with no barrier. The whispered message is audible only to the target. The creature that receives the message can whisper a reply that the caster can hear. The spell transmits sound, not meaning. It does not transcend language barriers. Unlike casting most spells, the gestures of this spell are subtle, and it is easy to conceal that the spell is being cast.' },
    { name: 'Read Magic', level: 1, page: 125, duration: 'Instantaneous', range: '0', description: 'By means of Read Magic, the caster can decipher magical inscriptions on objects—books, scrolls, weapons, and the like—that would otherwise be unintelligible. This does not normally invoke the magic contained in the writing, although it can do so in the case of a cursed scroll. Furthermore, once the spell is cast and the caster has read the magical inscription, he thereafter is able to read that particular writing without recourse to the use of Read Magic. All spellbooks are written such that only the Elf or Magic-User who owns the book can decipher it without the use of this spell. Each casting of the spell allows the reading of 1d4 items. <br/><br/>If a character loses access to Read Magic (a spellbook is stolen or destroyed, for instance), the character must research the spell as if it was unknown to him and then written up in a new spellbook.' },
    { name: 'Shield', level: 1, page: 128, duration: '2 Turns', range: 'Touch', description: 'Magic-Users are masters of matter and as such can command objects racing towards them to stop. The objects are sometimes impertinent, it is true, but this spell will protect the caster from many attacks which would otherwise harm him. Against missile attacks, the spell grants the caster AC 19, and an effective AC 17 for all other attacks. Even if an attack hits, it does one less point of damage than it otherwise would have.' },

The caster can only affect 1 creature if it has 4+1 or more Hit Dice, but the spell will otherwise affect creatures totaling no more than 2d8 Hit Dice. Calculate monsters with less than 1 Hit Die as having 1 Hit Die, and monsters with a bonus to their Hit Dice as having the flat amount. For example, a 3+2 Hit Die monster would be calculated as having 3 Hit Dice. Excess Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. Creatures with the fewest Hit Dice are affected first. Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not. Sleep does not affect undead, constructs, or other magical or unnatural creatures (such as Elves).' },

It can run and fetch things, open unstuck doors, and hold chairs, as well as clean and mend. It can open only normal doors, drawers, lids, and the like. It can lift 20 pounds or drag 40 pounds. The Servant cannot attack in any way, and it cannot be killed because it is a magical force, not a living thing.' },

    { name: 'Audible Glamour', level: 2, page: 91, duration: '1 Round/level', range: '60\' + 10\'/level', description: 'The caster of this spell is able to create false sound. The sound can be centered anywhere within range, and within that range the sound can fluctuate and move, imitating approaching or receding footsteps, laughter, voices, or whatever else the caster desires. Beings are allowed a saving throw versus Magic to realize that the effect is illusory, but only if they actively attempt to disbelieve.' },
    { name: 'Change Self', level: 2, page: 92, duration: '1 Turn/level', range: '0', description: 'This spell creates a dweomer of illusion, altering the caster’s appearance. The illusion must take the appearance of a humanoid, not taller or shorter than the caster by more than 1\', but apparent weight and clothing or items can be altered in any way. This does not affect the voice, abilities, and skills of the caster—only his appearance.' },
    { name: 'Detect Invisible', level: 2, page: 99, duration: '5 Rounds/level', range: '10\'/level', description: 'By means of this spell the caster is able to see invisible characters, creatures, or objects within the given range, seeing them as translucent shapes.' },
    { name: 'ESP', level: 2, page: 103, duration: '1 Turn', range: '60\'', description: 'If you know how to listen, thoughts are as audible as any voice, and those who care not about the privacy of all living things can hear them. This spell allows the Magic-User to perceive the thoughts of one character within 60\' of him at a time. The caster understands the meaning of all thoughts even if he does not share the person’s language. The ability to hear thoughts is obstructed by rock 2\' thick or greater, or any amount of lead.' },
    { name: 'Force of Forbidment', level: 2, page: 105, duration: '1 Turn/level or until concentration lapses', range: '120\'', description: 'The caster can block one subject of less than 6 Hit Dice from being able to advance past a certain point, the subject being blocked by a wall of magical force. A saving throw versus Magic applies, but at –2. The caster must maintain concentration thereafter in order to continue blocking the creature. Missiles will penetrate the magical force, and can do so in either direction. However, magical arrows are disenchanted if they pass through the barrier.' },
    { name: 'Forget', level: 2, page: 106, duration: 'Permanent', range: '30\'', description: 'This spell allows the caster to obliterate the memory of an opponent. The time span is equal to the previous 1 Round, +1 Round per 3 levels of the caster. This spell only affects memory, it does not alter any actual events that have taken place or nullify any other spell effects. The spell is capable of affecting up to 4 beings in range who are allowed a saving throw versus Magic, which is modified depending on how many creatures are targeted. No modifier is applied if 3 or 4 creatures are targeted, but if 2 are targeted the save is at –1, and –2 if only one being is targeted.' },
    { name: 'Invisibility', level: 2, page: 111, duration: '1 Turn/level', range: 'Touch', description: 'With this spell the Magic-User frightens the light of the world, causing it to avoid the subject of the spell. This causes the subject, including all carried equipment, to completely vanish from sight. Equipment that is dropped becomes visible, and items picked up disappear. Light sources carried by the subject cannot be seen by others, but can be seen by the subject. <br/><br/>The subject still makes noise, emits odor, etc., as usual. The subject still has physical mass and can touch and be touched. If the subject makes any sort of offensive action, such as attacking someone, tripping someone, using force to break an object, setting fire to a structure, basically taking any violent action at all, that action enrages the world’s light so much that it attempts to attack the subject, resulting in the invisibility being dispelled just after the violent deed is performed. Note that being successful in a violent deed is not necessary; an invisible character that attacks and misses a target still becomes visible.' },
    { name: 'Knock', level: 2, page: 112, duration: 'Instantaneous', range: '60\'', description: 'This spell allows the Magic-User to speak to a stuck, barred, locked, Held, or Wizard Locked door and convince it to open for him. It opens secret doors, as well as locked or trick-opening boxes and chests. It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains (provided they serve to hold shut something which can be opened). If used to open a Wizard Locked door, the spell does not remove the Wizard Lock, but simply suspends its functioning for one Turn. In all other cases, the door does not relock itself or become stuck again on its own. Knock will not raise a portcullis or operate any other similar mechanism, nor will it affect ropes, vines, and the like. Each spell can undo a single means of preventing access.' },
    { name: 'Levitate', level: 2, page: 113, duration: 'See Below', range: '20\'', description: 'Levitate allows the caster to move himself, another creature, or an object up and down as desired. An unwilling creature can make a saving throw versus Magic to avoid the effects, and an object must be unattended or the possessor is allowed a saving throw if he so wishes. By concentrating, the caster can mentally direct the recipient to move up or down as much as 20\' each Round. The caster cannot move the recipient horizontally, but the recipient could clamber along the face of a cliff, for example, or push against a ceiling to move laterally (generally at half his normal land speed). The spell lasts as long as the caster actively concentrates on it. If the Magic- User moves, engages in combat, is damaged, or takes any other action, the spell ends immediately.' },

The caster can search for general items, in which case the nearest one of its kind is located. Attempting to find a certain item requires a specific and accurate mental image; if the image is not close enough to the actual object, the spell fails. Living creatures or animate constructs cannot be located using Locate Object. <br/><br/>The reverse of this spell, Hide Object, makes the location of one object (which must be touched at the time of casting) completely unknown and unknowable to anyone not able to directly sense it (through sight, hearing, smell, etc.) for the duration of the spell.' },

Since all of the mirror images are the caster, in the same situation and fighting the same battle in their own timeline, they are indistinguishable in every way from the caster and mimic his every motion. When an opponent makes a successful attack against one of the duplicates, it instantly dies and dissipates into nothingness (the others remain). If an opponent attempts to attack a Magic-User obscured by this spell, it is randomly determined whether the to-hit roll is directed toward the caster or one of the duplicates. Note that the duplicates do not take independent action; they are just “mirror images” as the spell name implies.' },

However, it only exists in the minds of those seeing, smelling, or hearing it. The first time a phantasmal creature causes damage in combat, the victim receives a saving throw versus Magic. Success means the creature ceases to exist as far as that character is concerned and no damage is taken, otherwise, the illusion is as deadly as any real creature. The illusion is dispelled the first time it is hit in combat by someone who believes in it.' },

The caster can ask questions of, and receive answers from, one particular kind of animal, although the spell does not make it any more friendly or cooperative than normal.

The spell cannot penetrate metal; sheets of any type of metal between the caster and the target area will prevent the Magic-User from being able to scry upon the area. The caster will be able to hear sounds in a 10\' radius of the spell’s focal point even if the area is dark. If the area is not dark, the caster will be able to see as if he were standing at the spell’s focal point, for a normal distance, but in all directions at once.' },

If cast on the same Segment in combat as a spell from an enemy combatant, Dispel Magic can be used to disrupt and negate that spell. <br/><br/>All magical items within the area of effect are temporarily disenchanted. They regain their enchantment after 2d6 Turns, but one-use items such as potions and scrolls (but not spellbooks) are permanently nullified. <br/><br/>There is one important exception—a Magic-User’s Dispel Magic has no effect on Cleric spells.

The object on which the runes were written is obliterated, unless it is unaffected by fire. The caster and any other beings specifically instructed can read the protected writing without triggering the runes. Likewise, the caster can remove the runes whenever desired. Another creature can remove them with a successful casting of the Dispel Magic spell. A Magic- User has a 5% chance per level of detecting the runes while a Specialist has a flat 5% chance.' },

The transformation takes a full Turn to take effect. Once complete, he will move with the speed and nimbleness of a wolf (180\' movement rate). His senses also become heightened and he is able to eat raw meat with no ill effects. His savage attacks are +2 to hit and he inflicts 1d6 damage with nothing but his bare hands and teeth.

After the spell is cast, and if the victim fails a saving throw versus Magic, the caster can implant a suggestion in the mind of one listener. This suggestion will lie buried in the victim\'s mind until a trigger event, set by the caster, occurs. Then the victim will carry out the suggested action. A more subtle suggestion not having to do with specific actions (for example, suggesting that a certain person or group is evil or undesirable) will instead affect the victim\'s attitudes, but after every time that the victim behaves in a manner contrary to his regular nature he receives an additional saving throw versus Magic to shake off the effects of the spell. <br/><br/>See book for details.' },

The caster must articulate his desires if he expects the subject to fulfill them. <br/><br/>Any request which is not against the subject’s interests or personality will be followed. Any request which is against the subject’s interests or personality triggers a saving throw versus Magic to refuse the request. If the saving throw is successful, the request will be refused, but it will not break the Charm. If as part of a request, the caster promises the subject something that the subject is normally inclined to want, then this saving throw is not necessary, and the subject will comply. <br/><br/>Only one monster is charmed if it has more than four Hit Dice, otherwise 3d6 monsters of 4 or less Hit Dice are affected. Undead creatures are unaffected by this spell. Abuse or neglect of the subject will trigger another saving throw to negate the Charm, and murderous violence towards the subject also triggers a save, but with a +5 bonus to the roll.

This spirit is invisible to all but the caster. The area must be close to the caster, however, for if the caster is more than 30\' from the area the spirit guards, it will return to the outer realm. The spirit can detect virtually any creature that enters the area: it can detect invisibility, can see creatures that are moving between dimensions, and can detect virtually any other method that might be employed to sneak into an area. If any creature larger than a cat or small dog enters the area, the spirit will begin howling with its echoing, supernatural bay. Moreover, it will seek to attack intruders from behind (it does not make frontal assaults) and can attack as a monster of 10 Hit Dice for 3d6 damage, even if the opponent requires up to a +3 magical weapon to be hit.

The affected creature is unable to speak, cast spells, understand language, or communicate coherently. The subject remains in this state until a Dispel Magic or Remove Curse spell is used to cancel the effect of the Feeblemind. <br/><br/>However, if the target succeeds with his saving throw, he is considered to be under the effect of a Haste spell for as many Rounds as the caster has levels.' },

A paralyzed swimmer cannot swim and may drown. <br/><br/>If a magic item or spell operates to partially negate the effects of paralysis, failure on the saving throw will have the effect of a Slow spell rather than completely immobilizing the target.' },

The spell ends when the caster sends his soul back to his own body, leaving the receptacle empty. <br/><br/>To cast the spell, the magic jar must be within spell range. While in the magic jar, the caster can sense and attack any life force. Attempting to possess a body is a full-Round action. The caster possesses the body and forces the creature’s soul into the magic jar unless the subject succeeds a saving throw versus Magic. Failure to take over the host leaves the caster’s life force in the magic jar, and the target automatically succeeds on further saving throws if the caster attempts to possess its body again. <br/><br/>See book for details.' },

One or two Hit Dice must be assigned to each undead as the caster desires. This is each undead’s Hit Dice for the purposes of its Hit Points, saving throws, and to hit rolls. If the undead is to have special abilities, each increases the Hit Dice “cost” by one (except energy drain, which increases it by two).

    { name: 'Prismatic Wall', level: 7, page: 122, duration: '1 Turn/Level', range: '10\'', description: 'Prismatic Wall creates a vertical, opaque wall—a shimmering, multicolored plane of light that protects the caster from all forms of attack. For all purposes this spell functions identically to the Magic- User spell Prismatic Sphere, except a shimmering wall is produced rather than an opaque globe. <br/><br/>See book for details.' },
    { name: 'Remote Surveillance', level: 7, page: 125, duration: '1 Turn/level', range: 'Touch', description: 'This spell enables a caster to enchant a particular item. The first person or creature to handle that item immediately becomes a conduit for the caster, with no saving throw. The victim will not realize that he is the victim of a spell. <br/><br/>When this happens, the caster is immediately aware of the spell’s activation. The caster can then experience all of the subject’s senses. In effect, the subject of the spell becomes the caster’s perfect spy. The caster can also cast spells through the subject of the spell. However, the caster cannot read the subject’s mind, nor does the caster find anything out about the subject. There could be circumstances where the caster does not even know where the subject is. All that the caster becomes aware of is that the spell is active, and from that point is also aware of whatever the subject sees, hears, smells, tastes, or touches until the duration of the spell ends.' },
    { name: 'Reverse Gravity', level: 7, page: 127, duration: '1 Round', range: '5\'/level', description: 'Nature is a Magic-User’s plaything, and this spell commands the earth to throw away people and objects standing upon it. This affects a 30\' squared area, causing all unattached objects and creatures within that area to “fall” upward 20\'. If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it in the same manner as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the maximum height without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, until the spell ends. At the end of the spell duration, affected objects and creatures fall downward, suffering the usual falling damage when they hit the ground.' },
    { name: 'Simulacrum', level: 7, page: 129, duration: 'Permanent', range: 'Touch', description: 'Simulacrum creates a pseudo-duplicate of any creature. The spell is cast over a rough snow or ice form, and some piece of the creature to be duplicated (hair, nail, or the like) must be placed inside the snow or ice. The simulacrum appears to be the same as the original, but it has only one-half of the real creature’s Hit Points. The duplicate has a faulty memory of the original’s life, but will remember most details 30% of the time. At all times, the simulacrum remains under the caster’s absolute command. No special telepathic link exists, so command must be exercised in some other manner. A simulacrum has no ability to become more powerful. It cannot increase its level or abilities. If reduced to 0 Hit Points or otherwise destroyed, a simulacrum reverts to snow and melts instantly into nothingness. A simulacrum will radiate magic with a Detect Magic spell, and True Seeing will reveal a simulacrum’s true nature.' },
    { name: 'Spell Turning', level: 7, page: 131, duration: '1 Round/level', range: '0', description: 'Spells and spell-like effects targeted on the caster are turned back upon the original caster. The spell turns only effects that have the caster as a singular target. Area effect spells are not affected. Spell Turning also fails to stop touch range spells. When a spell is turned, the original caster receives a saving throw if the spell normally calls for one.' },
    { name: 'Statue', level: 7, page: 131, duration: '6 Turns/level', range: 'Touch', description: 'A Statue spell turns the caster or a subject to solid stone, along with any garments and equipment worn or carried. The subject can see, hear, and smell normally, but it does not need to eat or breathe. Feeling is limited to those sensations that can affect the granite-hard substance of the individual’s body. Chipping is equal to a mere scratch, but breaking off one of the statue’s arms constitutes serious damage. The subject of a Statue spell can return to its normal state, act, and then return instantly to the statue state if it so desires, as long as the spell duration is in effect.' },
    { name: 'Vanish', level: 7, page: 148, duration: 'Permanent', range: 'Touch', description: 'By casting this spell, a Magic-User can teleport an object as per the spell Teleport, or even banish the object to the spirit plane, in which case the object is replaced in the material plane with small stone that matches the object’s shape. A total of 50 pounds per level, not to exceed a volume of 3\' cubed per level, can be caused to vanish in this manner. If the spell Dispel Magic is cast upon the stone item that replaced the object of the Vanish spell, it might bring back the original item.' },
    { name: 'Vision', level: 7, page: 148, duration: 'Instantaneous', range: '0', description: 'This spell calls upon the greater Powers of the universe to impart knowledge unto the caster. The caster must have a specific question in mind when casting, and if the spell is successful, the caster falls into a hallucinogenic daze as the information floods his mind. <br/><br/>See book for details.' },
    { name: 'Witchlamp Aura', level: 7, page: 151, duration: '1 Round/level', range: '0', description: 'When the Aura is in effect, any magic cast upon or including the caster in its area of effect is affected in multiple ways. <br/><br/>See book for details.' },
    // Level 8
    { name: 'Antipathy/Sympathy', level: 8, page: 90, duration: 'Permanent', range: '30\'', description: 'This spell causes an object or location to emanate magical vibrations that either attract or repel either a specific kind of intelligent creature or creatures of a particular alignment. If alignment is used as a qualifier, the options are Lawful or Chaotic; Neutral is not an option. <br/><br/>If the spell is used to create Antipathy, creatures of the designated kind or alignment feel an overpowering urge to leave the area or to avoid the affected item. A compulsion forces them to abandon the area or item, shunning it and never willingly returning to it while the spell is in effect. A creature that makes a successful saving throw versus Magic can stay in the area and even touch the item, but feels uncomfortable in doing so. <br/><br/>If the spell is used to create Sympathy, an object or location emanates magical vibrations that attract the designated target type, causing them to feel elated and pleased to be in the area or desire to touch or possess the object. The compulsion to stay in the area or touch the object is overpowering. This compulsion can be overcome with a successful save versus magic. If the save is successful, the creature is released from the spell, but a subsequent save must be made 1d6 × 10 minutes later. If this save fails, the affected creature attempts to return to the area or object.' },
    { name: 'Charm Person, Mass', level: 8, page: 94, duration: 'See Below', range: '5\'/level', description: 'The Mass Charm Person spell makes a number of subjects (twice the total number of Hit Dice as the caster’s level) utterly enamored with the caster and desperate to please him. Each receives a saving throw versus Magic to resist the charm. This is not mind control, as each subject retains his personality and controls how he acts but for his utter fascination with the caster. The caster must articulate his desires if he expects the subject to fulfill them. <br/><br/>Any request which is not against the subjects’ interests or personality will be followed. Any request which is against the subjects’ interests or personality triggers a saving throw to refuse the request. If the saving throw is successful, the request will be refused, but this will not break the Charm. If as part of a request, the caster promises the subjects something that they are normally inclined to want, then this saving throw is not necessary, and the subjects will comply. <br/><br/>This spell works on all humans and human-like creatures (except Elves); non-human or demihuman humanoids are not affected if they have more than four Hit Dice. Abuse or neglect of the subjects will trigger another saving throw to negate the Charm, and murderous violence towards the subjects also triggers a save, but with a +5 bonus to the roll. The subjects, if intelligent, will realize that they have been victims to mesmerism and retain full memory of their actions while under the Charm after the spell ends.' },
    { name: 'Clone', level: 8, page: 94, duration: 'Instantaneous', range: 'Touch', description: 'This spell allows the growth of a perfect physical duplicate of a person (or any living creature) and pulls the consciousness of that person from an alternate timeline, trapping it in the false body. To create the duplicate body, the Magic-User must have access to this spell, and a small piece of flesh from the creature to be duplicated. Then, using a laboratory worth at least 15,000 sp, the new body is grown from this piece of flesh. This process takes 2d4 months, –1d4 weeks if an alchemist is present the entire time. <br/><br/>Once the duplicate reaches maturity, the Magic- User can then cast the spell and this is what imprisons the alternate timeline version of the original person in this clone body. <br/><br/>The alternate version of the person is exactly like the original in all ways, but if the clone becomes aware of the original, he will believe that the original is an abomination to be destroyed. The clone may not be so happy about the caster pulling him “through a gate” and robbing him of all his possessions (the Clone spell does not duplicate items), so the caster must also prepare for this. <br/><br/>The clone acts and thinks just as the original because it is the original in every respect. Yet because the timelines are not identical, anyone who knows both the original and comes into contact with the clone has only a 1% chance in any situation of detecting that the clone is not the original.' },
    { name: 'Demand', level: 8, page: 99, duration: 'Permanent until Triggered', range: 'See Below', description: 'Personal objects, bodily refuse such as hair or nail clippings, or even freely given gifts are dangerous in the hands of a wizard. Demand allows the caster to mentally contact the previous owner of such an object, provided the mage has it in his possession, delivering both a message and a Suggestion (as per the spell) unless the target makes a saving throw versus Magic.' },
    { name: 'Maze', level: 8, page: 116, duration: 'See Below', range: '5\'/level', description: 'The caster banishes the subject into an extra dimensional labyrinth. The number of Turns or Rounds the subject takes to escape this labyrinth is determined by his Intelligence. Referees should estimate the targeted Intelligence of the monster or NPC (if it has no given stats). <br/><br/>See book for details.' },
    { name: 'Mind Blank', level: 8, page: 116, duration: '1 Turn/level', range: '30\'', description: 'The subject is protected from all devices and spells that detect, influence, or read emotions or thoughts. This spell protects against all mind-affecting spells and effects as well as information gathering by divination spells or effects. In the case of scrying that scans an area the creature is in, such as a crystal ball, the spell works, but the subject of the Mind Blank spell is simply not detected. Scrying attempts that are targeted specifically at the subject do not work at all.' },
    { name: 'Permanency', level: 8, page: 119, duration: 'Permanent', range: 'Touch', description: 'The Permanency spell makes other spell effects permanent. It is also used to lock the enchantments of a magic item permanently into the item, such magical items, wands, and staves. Certain spells can be made permanent upon the caster or another creature, and other spells can be made permanent only if cast upon an area or an object. Each use of this spell requires the caster to make a saving throw versus Magic; failure permanently reduces the caster’s Constitution by 1 point. <br/><br/>See book for details.' },
    { name: 'Polymorph Any Object', level: 8, page: 120, duration: 'Permanent', range: '5\' per level', description: 'This transforms one object or creature into another. Objects can be changed into living creatures, creatures can be turned to plants, etc. Subjects cannot be transformed into specific creatures or items—a rock can be turned into a human, but not into the king of the realm, for example. Objects transformed across kingdoms (Plant, Animal, Mineral) cannot increase mass by more than three times. The spell Dispel Magic will reverse the effects of this spell. All objects or creatures affected by this spell will radiate magic should such detections be made. <br/><br/>This spell can also be used to duplicate the effects of Flesh to Stone, Stone to Flesh, and similar spells that alter matter. When this spell is used to create the effects of Flesh to Stone, the victim makes a saving throw with a penalty of –4.' },
    { name: 'Symbol', level: 8, page: 144, duration: 'Permanent until Triggered', range: 'Touch', description: 'This spell allows the caster to scribe a potent rune of power upon a surface. There are eight different Symbols, each with a different effect. Symbols are triggered by being read, touched, or if a creature passes through a door with a Symbol inscribed on it. The only way a Symbol can be identified is by reading it, which triggers the effects. <br/><br/>See book for details.' },
    { name: 'Trap the Soul', level: 8, page: 146, duration: 'Permanent', range: '10\'', description: 'Trap the Soul forces a creature’s life force (and material body) into a gem. The gem holds the trapped entity indefinitely or until the gem is broken and the life force is released, allowing the material body to reform. Before the actual casting of Trap the Soul, the caster must procure a gem of at least 1,000 sp value for every Hit Die possessed by the creature to be trapped. The spell can be triggered in one of two ways. <br/><br/>See book for details.' },
    // Level 9
    { name: 'Imprisonment', level: 9, page: 110, duration: 'Permanent', range: 'Touch', description: 'When the caster casts Imprisonment and touches a creature, if it fails a saving throw versus Magic it is entombed in a state of suspended animation in a small sphere far beneath the surface of the earth. The subject remains there unless a Freedom spell (the reverse of Imprisonment) is cast at the locale where the imprisonment took place. Magical search by a crystal ball, a Locate Object spell, or some other similar divination does not reveal the fact that the creature has been imprisoned.' },
    { name: 'Power Word Kill', level: 9, page: 121, duration: 'Instantaneous', range: '2.5\'/caster level', description: 'The caster utters a single word of power that instantly kills one or more creatures within a 20\' diameter, whether the creatures can hear the word or not. This spell will kill multiple creatures if they have less than 11 Hit Points each, or the spell will kill a single creature that has 60 Hit Points or less. The caster must choose whether he is attempting to kill one creature or multiple creatures when he casts the spell. If multiple creatures are targeted, a maximum of 120 Hit Points’ total of creatures can be killed. Any creature that has 61 or more Hit Points is unaffected by Power Word Kill. There is no saving throw against this spell.' },
    { name: 'Shape Change', level: 9, page: 128, duration: '1 Turn/level', range: '0', description: 'This spell enables the caster to assume the form of any single non-unique creature (of any type) except for particularly powerful creatures like demons, devils, or demi-gods. The caster’s Hit Points remain the same. The caster gains all of the extraordinary and supernatural abilities (both attacks and qualities) of the assumed form, except for any abilities relying on the knowledge or intelligence of the monster, because the caster’s mind remains his own. The caster can change form once each Round for the duration of the spell.' },
    { name: 'Temporal Stasis', level: 9, page: 145, duration: 'Permanent', range: 'Touch', description: 'The subject is placed into a state of suspended animation. For the character so afflicted, time ceases to flow. The character does not grow older, and his body functions virtually cease. This state persists until the magic is removed (such as with Dispel Magic spell). No saving throw is permitted.' },
    { name: 'Time Stop', level: 9, page: 145, duration: 'See Below', range: '0', description: 'This spell brings all of creation (and anti-creation) to a complete halt, while allowing the caster the freedom to act in this inert universe. Because existence wants to be active, this spell cannot last long. The caster can take 1d4+2 Rounds worth of actions (the exact amount rolled by the Referee in secret) instantly, as the caster acts within the folds of adjacent moments.' }
