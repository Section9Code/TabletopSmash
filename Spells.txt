Airy Water
Page: 89
Magic-User Level 5
Duration: 1 Turn/level
Range: 0
The caster of this spell creates a bubble of altered
water in a body of water (or water-based medium).
Within this bubble there is a breathable atmosphere.
The bubble sinks in water; the center of the
bubble is on the caster and moves with him. The
area of effect is either a 20' radius globe, or a 40'
radius hemisphere, caster’s choice. Aquatic creatures
cannot swim while in this bubble, as it is only
slightly denser than air. Likewise, water breathing
creatures cannot breathe within the area of affect.
Intelligent aquatic creatures will not enter the area
of effect by mistake.



Animate Dead
Page: 89
Magic-User Level 5
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: 10'
This spell energizes the faint memories of life that
cling to the corpses and skeletons of people, allowing
them to move and act in a gross mockery of their
former existence. Because the entities inhabiting
these bodies are chosen by the caster, these undead
are under his total control. However, the faint
memories of life retained by the corpse or skeleton
constantly struggles with the invader introduced by
the caster, a conflict that drives the host corpse or
skeleton to destructive urges. The animated dead
will always interpret any instructions in the most
violent and destructive manner possible. They will
also prefer to attack those that they knew in life, no
matter their former relationship with the person in
question. The bodies remain animated until they are
destroyed.

For each level of the caster, he creates 1 Hit Die,
the total of which is then used to determine the Hit
Dice of the undead and any special abilities. One or
two Hit Dice must be assigned to each undead as
the caster desires. This is each undead’s Hit Dice for
the purposes of its Hit Points, saving throws, and to 
hit rolls. If the undead is to have special abilities,
each increases the Hit Dice “cost” by one (except
energy drain, which increases it by two). Adding
special abilities does not increase the actual Hit
Dice of the undead. Only mindless undead are created
by this spell, and they must be commanded
verbally.

Magic-User Level 6
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: 10'
This spell energizes the faint memories of life that
cling to the corpses and skeletons of creatures, animating
them to a mocking caricature of their living
selves. Each creature’s intellect and willpower is no
longer present, allowing these undead to be under
the total control of the caster. However, the faint
memories of life retained by the corpse or skeleton
constantly struggles with the invader introduced
by the caster, a conflict that drives the host corpse
or skeleton to destructive urges. They will always
interpret any instructions in the most violent and
destructive manner possible. The bodies remain
animated until they are destroyed.

For each level of the caster, he creates 1 Hit Die,
the total of which is then used to determine the Hit

the purposes of its Hit Points, saving throws, and
to hit rolls. If the undead is to have special abilities,
each increases the Hit Dice “cost” by one (except
energy drain, which increases it by two). Adding
special abilities does not increase the actual Hit
Dice of the undead. Only mindless undead are created
by this spell, and they must be commanded
verbally.



Animated Artwork
Page: 90
Magic-User Level 7
Duration: 1 Round/level
Range: 30'
The caster can pull an object or creature depicted in
a piece of art, such as a drawing, painting, etc., into
the real world. The object can be used as if it were
real (it now is!), and any creature or person seeing
the object or creature will believe it to be the same
as that depicted in the artwork, complete with the
full abilities of either the object or creature, but now
under control of the caster.

Note that the quality of the piece will affect the
power of the creature or item in the real world. A
masterwork piece of art (defined as being worth
1,000+ sp) will yield perfect creations; a work of
lesser, but still serviceable quality will provide creations
that are only 50% as effective; and anything
less (scribbles on paper!) will be at 25% effectiveness.
Drawing a quick serviceable doodle takes two
Rounds. Creating a masterwork piece of art takes
weeks, if not months.



Anti-Magic Shell
Page: 90
Cleric Level 6
Duration: 1 Turn/level
Range: 0
Casting this spell restores the supremacy of natural
order in a small area for a short amount of time.
Within a 10' radius around the caster, all magic
(except Cleric spellcasting) is negated for the full
duration of the spell. Magical attacks will not affect
the caster, magic items and spells within the radius
are suppressed, and the caster cannot perform further
magic until the spell has expired. Spells cast
through the Anti-Magic area will also be ineffective.
Innately magical creatures cannot pass through the
area, but magical beings with physical form will
merely lose all of their magical abilities while in
the Anti-Magic area. The area affected by the Anti-
Magic Shell is stationary and does not move with
the caster.



Antipathy/Sympathy
Page: 90
Magic-User Level 8
Duration: Permanent
Range: 30'
This spell causes an object or location to emanate
magical vibrations that either attract or repel either
a specific kind of intelligent creature or creatures
of a particular alignment. If alignment is used as a
qualifier, the options are Lawful or Chaotic; Neutral
is not an option.

If the spell is used to create Antipathy, creatures
of the designated kind or alignment feel an overpowering 
urge to leave the area or to avoid the affected item. 
A compulsion forces them to abandon the area or item, 
shunning it and never willingly returning to it while 
the spell is in effect. A creature that makes a successful 
saving throw versus Magic can stay in the area and 
even touch the item, but feels uncomfortable in doing so.

If the spell is used to create Sympathy, an object
or location emanates magical vibrations that attract
the designated target type, causing them to feel
elated and pleased to be in the area or desire to
touch or possess the object. The compulsion to stay
in the area or touch the object is overpowering. This
compulsion can be overcome with a successful save
versus magic. If the save is successful, the creature is
released from the spell, but a subsequent save must
be made 1d6 × 10 minutes later. If this save fails, the
affected creature attempts to return to the area or
object.



Army of One
Page: 91
Magic-User Level 3
Duration: 1 Round/level
Range: Touch
The recipient of this spell becomes a peerless warrior,
able to move in battle with inhuman reflexes
in order to attack enemies within immediate mêlée
range. The subject is able to make one mêlée attack
for every opponent already engaging him. Each
attack must be against a different opponent, and the
extra attacks are not gained if the subject must move
to engage a foe.



Audible Glamour
Page: 91
Magic-User Level 2
Duration: 1 Round/level
Range: 60' + 10'/level
The caster of this spell is able to create false sound.
The sound can be centered anywhere within range,
and within that range the sound can fluctuate and
move, imitating approaching or receding footsteps,
laughter, voices, or whatever else the caster desires.
Beings are allowed a saving throw versus Magic to
realize that the effect is illusory, but only if they
actively attempt to disbelieve.



Augury
Page: 91
Cleric Level 2
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: 0
This spell allows the caster to see a vision of all
timelines, possibilities, and probabilities for but
a moment, allowing him the chance to determine
whether a particular action will bring weal or woe.
Because the caster is afforded only a glimpse of the
possibilities, and because he does not know all the
forces at work at any particular time, the vision can
be misinterpreted.

The base chance for deciphering a true answer is
70% + 1% per caster level. This roll is made secretly.
The Augury can see into the future only 3 Turns,
so anything that might happen after that does not
affect the result. Thus, the result will not take into
account the long-term consequences of a contemplated
action.

If there is a reward for a particular action, but
no risk, the answer is “weal.” If a certain action will
bring the caster closer to a stated goal, the answer
is “weal.” If there is a reward for a particular action,
but risk involved, the answer is “weal.” Risk, but no
reward is “woe.” Reward, but with overwhelming
risk is “woe.” An action that leads the caster further
away from a stated goal is “woe.” The Referee must
judge all outcomes to determine the correct answer.
If there is no clear answer, then there is a flat 50%
chance of either “weal” or “woe.” These answers are
for successful rolls as noted above, and a failed roll
will always give the opposite answer.



Barrier
Page: 91
Magic-User Level 6
Duration: 3 Rounds/level
Range: 30'
This spell creates a wall of whirling steel (of whatever
shape the caster desires) up to 20' long per
caster level, or a ring of whirling steel centered on
the caster with a radius of up to 5' per two levels.
Either form will be up to 20' high (as allowed by
available space). Any creature passing through
the wall, including the caster, takes 1d6 points of
damage per caster level (maximum 15d6), with a
save versus Breath Weapon reducing the damage
by half.

If the caster evokes the Barrier so that it appears
where creatures are, each creature takes damage as
if passing through the wall. Each creature can avoid
the wall (ending up on the side of its choice) and
thus take no damage by making a successful save
versus Breath Weapon.

A Barrier provides cover (+4 Armor Class
bonus) against attacks made through it (in either
direction).



Bestow Spell Ability
Page: 92
Magic-User Level 7
Duration: Special
Range: Touch
This spell allows a Magic-User to grant some of his
own spell ability to a subject. When casting this
spell, the caster chooses spells he has already prepared
and transfers those spells to the subject. The
subject now has those spells prepared (and casts
them at his level, not that the original Magic-User),
while the original caster no longer does.

Furthermore, until the subject casts the spells
that he has been granted, the Magic-User is unable
to prepare spells in those “slots.” For example, if a
Magic-User casts Bestow Spell Ability and grants his
Fighter comrade use of the Knock and Web spells,
the Magic-User loses the ability to prepare two
second level spells altogether until the Fighter casts
both spells.

If the subject dies without casting the granted
spells, the Magic-User regains his spell “slots” after
seven days.



Bless
Page: 92
Cleric Level 1
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: Touch
This spell bestows the favor of the Cleric's deity
upon the subject. That subject receives a number of
points (1d6 + caster's level) to allocate to any future
die rolls—To-Hit, saving throws, skill checks, surprise
checks, whatever the subject desires—except
damage rolls. The subject trades the points on a
one-for-one basis and can adjust the roll by that
many points however he sees fit. The number of
points to be used on a roll must be declared before
the roll is made. All unused points are lost at dawn
the following day.

No rolls relating to damage or anything concerning
the use of magic use can be modified by Bless.
Elves and other intrinsically magical creatures
cannot benefit from Bless.



Bookspeak
Page: 92
Magic-User Level 1
Duration: 1 Round/level
Range: Touch
When the subject of this spell touches a book, it
animates, forming a mouth around the edge where
the paper shows. The subject can ask the book one
question per Round, and if the information is contained
within the book, it will answer. If anyone else
approaches or asks questions the book snaps and
growls that Round instead of answering a question.
Intelligent books can save to resist the spell (as a
Magic-User of a level equal to the author). Magical
books do not impart their effect when they answer.
The spell is a shortcut to actually reading a book,
and it will not give more information than a careful
reading would.



Change Self
Page: 92
Magic-User Level 2
Duration: 1 Turn/level
Range: 0
This spell creates a dweomer of illusion, altering
the caster’s appearance. The illusion must take the
appearance of a humanoid, not taller or shorter than
the caster by more than 1', but apparent weight and
clothing or items can be altered in any way. This
does not affect the voice, abilities, and skills of the
caster—only his appearance.



Chaos
Page: 92
Magic-User Level 5
Duration: 1 Round/level
Range: 120'
This spell connects creatures with the greater truths
of the universe, so overwhelming them that they
behave strangely and unpredictably. All creatures in
the spell’s 30' radius area of effect become confused,
and only Magic-Users, Fighters, Dwarfs, Elves, and
creatures with an intelligence of 4 or lower are entitled
to a saving throw versus Magic at all. Creatures
that fail their saving throws (check each Round) act
randomly in accordance with the table in the book. See 
book for details.



Charm Monster
Page: 93
Magic-User Level 4
Duration: See Below
Range: 120'
The Charm Monster spell makes its subject utterly
enamored with the caster and desperate to please
him if the saving throw versus Magic is failed. This
is not mind control, as the subject retains its personality
and controls how it acts but for its utter
fascination with the caster. The caster must articulate
his desires if he expects the subject to fulfill
them.

Any request which is not against the subject’s
interests or personality will be followed. Any
request which is against the subject’s interests or
personality triggers a saving throw versus Magic to
refuse the request. If the saving throw is successful,
the request will be refused, but it will not break the
Charm. If as part of a request, the caster promises
the subject something that the subject is normally
inclined to want, then this saving throw is not necessary,
and the subject will comply.

Only one monster is charmed if it has more than
four Hit Dice, otherwise 3d6 monsters of 4 or less
Hit Dice are affected. Undead creatures are unaffected
by this spell. Abuse or neglect of the subject
will trigger another saving throw to negate the
Charm, and murderous violence towards the subject
also triggers a save, but with a +5 bonus to the
roll. The subject, if intelligent, will realize that it has
been victim to mesmerism and retain full memory
of its actions while under the Charm after the spell
ends.



Charm Person
Page: 93
Magic-User Level 1
Duration: See Below
Range: 120'
The Charm Person spell makes a single subject
utterly enamored with the caster and desperate to
please him if the saving throw versus Magic is failed.
This is not mind control, as the subject retains his
personality and controls how he acts but for his
utter fascination with the caster. The caster must
articulate his desires if he expects the subject to
fulfill them.

Any request which is not against the subject’s
interests or personality will be followed. Any
request which is against the subject’s interests or
personality triggers a saving throw to refuse the
request. If the saving throw is successful, the request
will be refused, but this will not break the Charm. If
as part of a request, the caster promises the subject
something that the subject is normally inclined to
want, then this saving throw is not necessary, and
the subject will comply.

This spell works on all humans and human-like
creatures (except Elves); other (non player character
class) humanoids are not affected if they have
more than four Hit Dice. Abuse or neglect of the
subject will trigger another saving throw to negate
the Charm, and murderous violence towards the
subject also triggers a save, but with a +5 bonus to
the roll. The subject, if intelligent, will realize that
he has been victim to mesmerism, and retain full
memory of his actions while under the Charm after
the spell ends.



Charm Person, Mass
Page: 94
Magic-User Level 8
Duration: See Below
Range: 5'/level
The Mass Charm Person spell makes a number of
subjects (twice the total number of Hit Dice as
the caster’s level) utterly enamored with the caster
and desperate to please him. Each receives a saving
throw versus Magic to resist the charm. This is not
mind control, as each subject retains his personality
and controls how he acts but for his utter fascination
with the caster. The caster must articulate his
desires if he expects the subject to fulfill them.

Any request which is not against the subjects’
interests or personality will be followed. Any
request which is against the subjects’ interests or
personality triggers a saving throw to refuse the
request. If the saving throw is successful, the request
will be refused, but this will not break the Charm. If
as part of a request, the caster promises the subjects
something that they are normally inclined to want,
then this saving throw is not necessary, and the subjects
will comply.

This spell works on all humans and human-like
creatures (except Elves); non-human or demihuman
humanoids are not affected if they have
more than four Hit Dice. Abuse or neglect of the
subjects will trigger another saving throw to negate
the Charm, and murderous violence towards the
subjects also triggers a save, but with a +5 bonus to
the roll. The subjects, if intelligent, will realize that
they have been victims to mesmerism and retain
full memory of their actions while under the Charm
after the spell ends.



Clairvoyance
Page: 94
Magic-User Level 3
Duration: 1 Turn/level
Range: See Below
Clairvoyance is a means of seeing and hearing events
at a distant location. There is no effective limit to the
spell’s range, but the location must either be familiar
to the caster or be obvious, such as the top floor
inside a tower that the caster can see, or just beyond
a dungeon door. The spell cannot penetrate metal;
sheets of any type of metal between the caster and
the target area will prevent the Magic-User from
being able to scry upon the area. The caster will be
able to hear sounds in a 10' radius of the spell’s focal
point even if the area is dark. If the area is not dark,
the caster will be able to see as if he were standing at
the spell’s focal point, for a normal distance, but in
all directions at once.



Clone
Page: 94
Magic-User Level 8
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: Touch
This spell allows the growth of a perfect physical
duplicate of a person (or any living creature) and
pulls the consciousness of that person from an alternate
timeline, trapping it in the false body.
To create the duplicate body, the Magic-User
must have access to this spell, and a small piece of
flesh from the creature to be duplicated. Then, using
a laboratory worth at least 15,000 sp, the new body
is grown from this piece of flesh. This process takes
2d4 months, –1d4 weeks if an alchemist is present
the entire time.

Once the duplicate reaches maturity, the Magic-
User can then cast the spell and this is what
imprisons the alternate timeline version of the
original person in this clone body.

The alternate version of the person is exactly like
the original in all ways, but if the clone becomes
aware of the original, he will believe that the original
is an abomination to be destroyed. The clone
may not be so happy about the caster pulling him
“through a gate” and robbing him of all his possessions
(the Clone spell does not duplicate items), so
the caster must also prepare for this.

The clone acts and thinks just as the original
because it is the original in every respect. Yet
because the timelines are not identical, anyone who
knows both the original and comes into contact
with the clone has only a 1% chance in any situation
of detecting that the clone is not the original.



Cloudkill
Page: 94
Magic-User Level 5
Duration: 1 Round/level
Range: 30'
Casting this spell allows the smoke emitted from the
infernal fires of Hell to spew forth onto the Earth to
cause destruction and suffering. A 20' cube cloud
of poison gas forms which moves at a rate of 10' per
Round under the control of the caster (so long as he
concentrates on it). The gas kills any creatures of 3
or fewer Hit Dice or levels it comes in contact with
if they fail a saving throw versus Poison; creatures
having 4 or more Hit Dice or levels are unaffected.
The cloud persists for the entire duration even if the
caster ceases to concentrate upon it, in which case
the cloud also remains immobile for the remainder
of the spell’s duration.



Command
Page: 95
Cleric Level 1
Duration: 1 Round
Range: 10'
When a Cleric casts this spell, he can give the subject
a single word command, which it obeys to the
best of its ability. The single word must make sense
as a single command, such as approach, drop, fall,
flee, halt, surrender, sleep, etc. Although a target
could be instructed to die, this will only make the
target collapse into a comatose state for a single
Round. Note that the caster must be able to speak
the language of the target. Any intended target that
has more than 5 levels or Hit Dice, or an Intelligence
of over 12 is entitled to a saving throw versus Magic.
This spell is ineffective against undead.



Commune
Page: 95
Cleric Level 5
Duration: See Below
Range: 0
By entering into deep meditation, the Cleric’s
spirit momentarily ascends to its final reward for a
glimpse of the afterlife for the devout believer. If the
Referee judges that the Cleric has not been faithful
to his religion, the Cleric must make a saving throw
versus Magic (Wisdom modifiers apply). If the roll
fails, then the Cleric finds himself in the afterlife
reserved for heretics and apostates—more horrible
than any other punishment reserved for mortal
souls. The spell will have no benefit, and the Cleric
will effectively age 1d10 years from the experience
as the soul returns to the body, ending the spell.

If the Cleric has been at the very least reasonably
devout, or succeeds in the saving throw, the
caster experiences the afterlife reserved for the
most blessed of his faith, the ultimate paradise. In
this place, all time and all knowledge are one. The
Cleric’s player can ask three questions that can be
answered “yes” or “no,” representing the Cleric’s
efforts to see specific events within the All, and the
Referee must answer each question truthfully.

If the spell is cast more than once a week and the
Cleric is not sufficiently devout, the saving throw
to prevent a glimpse of eternal damnation is made
at a –1 penalty, cumulative per number of times the
spell is cast. If the Cleric is devout, he must make
a saving throw versus Magic (Wisdom modifiers
apply inversely; a high Wisdom makes this saving
throw more difficult), with a –1 cumulative penalty
every additional time a week the spell is cast, or else
the overwhelming joy and vindication of his beliefs
is too strong and he will not return from paradise.



Comprehend Languages
Page: 95
Magic-User Level 1
Duration: 1 Turn/level
Range: 0
The caster can understand the spoken words of creatures
or read otherwise incomprehensible written
messages by summoning the spirits of the all-knowing
dead to translate for him. The creature or the
writing must be touched by the caster before the
spirits can deliver any translation. The ability to read
does not necessarily impart insight into the material,
merely its literal meaning. The spell enables the
caster to understand or read an unknown language,
not speak or write it.

Obscure Languages, the opposite of Comprehend
Languages, dispels the effects of Comprehend Languages,
or can be used to make spoken or written
language incomprehensible by summoning spirits
to possess the lips of a speaker, or the eyes of a
reader, ruining all chances of communication.



Confusion
Page: 96
Magic-User Level 4
Duration: 1 Round/level
Range: 120'
This spell touches the minds of any living creatures
within a 15' radius circle around the target point
to see the interconnectedness of everything in creation,
causing them to become confused, making
them unable to independently determine what
they will do as they struggle to determine which of
their actions will be least likely to ultimately lead to
the destruction of all matter. A saving throw versus
Magic is allowed to resist the effect. Roll on the following
table on each subject’s Initiative number
each Round to see what the subject will do.

See book for details.



Contact Outer Sphere
Page: 96
Magic-User Level 5
Duration: See Below
Range: 0
The stars are repositories of all knowledge. By
means of this spell, the Magic-User enters in communion
with the star of his choice in order to
receive wisdom and information. The caster asks
questions of the star, and the star answers. The stars
resent such intrusions and give only brief answers
to questions, and they often lie. All questions are
answered with “yes,” “no,” “maybe,” “never,” “irrelevant,”
or some other one-word answer.

The caster must concentrate on maintaining
the spell in order to ask questions at the rate of
one per Round. A question is answered by the star
during the same Round. The caster can choose how
many questions to ask, and which star to ask. The
chart below gives a sample of possible stars, with
the brightest stars being the most likely to answer
truthfully, but others may be available as the Referee
chooses.

See book for details.



Contingency
Page: 96
Magic-User Level 6
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: 0
This spell allows the caster to cast another spell on
himself, with its effect delayed until a specific situation
occurs as dictated by the caster.

The spell to be brought into effect by the Contingency
must be one that affects the caster’s person.

The conditions needed to bring the spell into
effect must be clear, although they can be general.
In all cases, the Contingency immediately brings into
effect the companion spell, the latter being “cast”
instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances
occur. If complicated or convoluted conditions are
prescribed, the whole spell combination (Contingency
and the companion magic) can fail when
called on. The companion spell occurs based solely
on the stated conditions of the Contingency spell,
regardless of whether or not the caster wants it to
at the time.

Only one Contingency can be in effect at a time;
if a second is cast, the first one (if still active) is
dispelled.



Control Weather
Page: 97
Cleric Level 7
Duration: 4d12 hours
Range: 0
To be in control of divine power is to control the
natural order, and this spell is the ultimate manifestation
of that control as the caster can change the
weather in the local area. It takes 1 Turn to cast the
spell and an additional 1d4 Turns for the effects to
manifest.

The caster controls the general tendencies of the
weather, such as the direction and intensity of the
wind, but cannot control specific applications of the
weather—where lightning strikes, for example, or
the exact path of a tornado. Contradictory weather
conditions are not possible simultaneously. Control
Weather can do away with atmospheric phenomena
(naturally occurring or otherwise) as well as create
them.

If the weather is completely foreign to the area,
the spell’s duration is cut in half.



Creation, Major
Page: 97
Magic-User Level 5
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: Touch
The caster creates an object of nonliving vegetable
(rope, cloth, wood, etc.) or inorganic (metal, stone,
plastic, etc.) matter. The volume of the item created
cannot exceed 1' cube per caster level. A tiny piece
of matter of the same sort of item the caster plans to
create must be used when casting Major Creation.
Thus, within the caster’s limits on the item’s volume,
he could create a basket from a piece of straw, a door
or club from a splinter of wood, a finely sculpted
throne from a pebble, etc.



Creation, Minor
Page: 97
Magic-User Level 4
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: Touch
The caster creates an object of nonliving vegetable
matter (rope, cloth, wood, etc.). The volume of the
item created cannot exceed 1' cube per caster level.
A tiny piece of matter of the same sort of item the
caster plans to create must be used when casting
Minor Creation. Thus, within the caster’s limits on
the item’s volume, he could create a basket from
a piece of straw, a door or club from a splinter of
wood, a cloak from a piece of wool, etc.



Cure Critical Wounds
Page: 97
Cleric Level 5
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: Touch
By the power of the Cleric’s faith, this spell restores
4d6 Hit Points to one damaged character, plus a
number of points equal to the level of the caster. For
example, if the caster is 13th level, the spell restores
4d6+13 Hit Points.

The spell can also be used to remove one temporary
negative condition instead of restoring lost
Hit Points. For example, if a character is paralyzed,
stunned, or blinded for a set period of time, then
this spell will remove any of these conditions. It will
not work on permanent conditions, and only one
condition (or damage) can be treated per casting of
the spell.

Recipients of the spell can only be restored to
their normal maximum Hit Points, and no more.
Any excess restored points are lost.
The reverse of the spell can only be used to inflict
points of damage.



Cure Disease
Page: 98
Cleric Level 3
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: Touch
Through the mercy of divine powers, this spell
allows a Cleric to cast out the sin and degeneracy in
a person that allows evil spirits to invade his body
and misalign his humors. Yet because man (and
demi-human) is a naturally immoral and spiritually
disgusting creature, the subject of the spell must
make a saving throw versus Magic in order for the
spell to be effective.

A successful casting instantly cures all diseases,
including mummy rot and lycanthropy. If used
against oozes or slimes, they do not receive a saving
throw and suffer 1d6 damage per level of the caster
(the cleric suffers an attack’s worth of damage when
touching the slime with this attack).

Cause Disease (the reverse of Cure Disease)
inflicts a terrible withering disease on a victim,
which will cause death in 2d12 days. A saving
throw versus Magic is allowed. This disease can be
cured with the casting of Cure Disease. The victim of
this disease cannot be cured of damage from other
spells, and it takes twice the time for normal healing.
This suffering further results in a penalty of –2
to hit rolls made by the victim.



Cure Light Wounds
Page: 98
Cleric Level 1
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: Touch
By the power of the Cleric’s faith, this spell restores
1d6 Hit Points to one damaged character, plus a
number of points equal to the level of the caster. For
example, if the caster is 5th level, the spell restores
1d6+5 Hit Points.

The spell can also be used to remove one temporary
negative condition instead of restoring lost
Hit Points. For example, if a character is paralyzed,
stunned, or blinded for a set period of time, then
this spell will remove any of these conditions. It will
not work on permanent conditions, and only one
condition (or damage) can be treated per casting of
the spell.

Recipients of the spell can only be restored to
their normal maximum Hit Points, and no more.
Any excess restored points are lost.
The reverse of the spell can only be used to inflict
points of damage.



Cure Serious Wounds
Page: 98
Cleric Level 4
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: Touch
By the power of the Cleric’s faith and the strength
of the life force of the wounded character, this spell
restores 1d6 Hit Points to one damaged character,
plus a number of points equal to the level of the
caster, plus a number of points equal to the level of
the subject. For example, if the caster is 10th level
and the character being healed is 5th level, the spell
restores 1d6+15 Hit Points.

The spell can also be used to remove one temporary
negative condition instead of restoring lost
Hit Points. For example, if a character is paralyzed,
stunned, or blinded for a set period of time, then
this spell will remove any of these conditions. It will
not work on permanent conditions, and only one
condition (or damage) can be treated per casting of
the spell.

Recipients of the spell can only be restored to
their normal maximum Hit Points, and no more.
Any excess restored points are lost.
The reverse of the spell can only be used to inflict
points of damage.



Death Spell
Page: 98
Magic-User Level 6
Duration: Permanent
Range: 10'/level
A living creature requires a certain amount of order
within its body to maintain its functions. This spell
causes the internal organs of its subject to stop functioning
as a greater whole, killing him immediately.

The victim is allowed to save versus Poison to resist
the spell; failure means instant death. Creatures
of 8 or more Hit Dice or levels are immune to the
spell, as are undead monsters, golems, and any other
“creature” that is not truly alive.



Delay Poison
Page: 99
Cleric Level 2
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: Touch
This spell counteracts the work of poison already
done, weakening it, giving its victim a new chance
at life. Any character that has succumbed to poison
within the previous 24 hours can immediately make
a new saving throw versus Poison to resist its effects
when this spell is cast.



Demand
Page: 99
Magic-User Level 8
Duration: Permanent until Triggered
Range: See Below
Personal objects, bodily refuse such as hair or nail
clippings, or even freely given gifts are dangerous
in the hands of a wizard. Demand allows the caster
to mentally contact the previous owner of such an
object, provided the mage has it in his possession,
delivering both a message and a Suggestion (as per
the spell) unless the target makes a saving throw
versus Magic.



Detect Evil
Page: 99
Cleric Level 1
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: Line of Sight
“Evil,” for purposes of this spell, is an in-game colloquial
term. It should properly be called “Detect
Chaos.”

This spell allows the caster to know if anything
that is within his field of vision (or on his person)
is Chaotic. For the purposes of this spell, Chaotic
is defined as, but not limited to, undead creatures,
any extra-dimensional or extra-planar creatures that
are not specifically Powers of Law or angels, any
creature with innate magical abilities (including
Magic-Users, but not Clerics), artifacts, symbols,
or sacred places dedicated to evil gods, and supernatural
creatures incapable of being good.

Mortal creatures, physical objects not directly
connected to evil deities, traps, poison, or places
where great atrocities have taken place are not considered
Chaotic or evil for the purposes of this spell.
It detects supernatural disturbances, not ill intent
or foul deeds.

Curiously, this spell does not detect magical
items or effects.

The reverse of this spell, Detect Good, detects Law
instead of Chaos.



Detect Illusion
Page: 99
Magic-User Level 3
Duration: 3 Rounds + 2 Rounds/level
Range: 0
The caster places this enchantment on himself to
grant sight that sees through illusion. Illusions can
be seen in an area of 10' wide, 10' long per level. The
caster can touch one other creature, granting it the
ability to see through illusion as well, so long as the
contact is maintained.



Detect Invisible
Page: 99
Magic-User Level 2
Duration: 5 Rounds/level
Range: 10'/level
By means of this spell the caster is able to see invisible
characters, creatures, or objects within the given
range, seeing them as translucent shapes.



Detect Lie
Page: 99
Cleric Level 4
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: 0
This spell allows the caster to determine if any one
statement made to him in the past hour was the
truth or a lie. Honest mistakes are not detected as
lies, nor are untrue statements made by charmed
or bewitched individuals, for they know not what
they say.



Detect Magic
Page: 100
Magic-User Level 1
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: Line of Sight
This spell allows the caster to know if anything
within his field of vision (or on his person) is in any
way magical. This includes magical creatures, magical
items, or any creature or object under the effect
of an ongoing spell. Spellcasters such as Magic-Users
and Elves do not detect as magic with this spell,
but anyone that is under the effects of an active spell
does.

The spell does not identify the nature of the
magic, only that magic is present.
The caster must already be able to see the object
in question in order to detect it as magical. Concealed,
covered, or invisible objects will not be
revealed by this spell.



Dig
Page: 100
Magic-User Level 4
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: 30'
This lesser form of Move Earth allows the caster
to dig or excavate areas of soil, mud, or sand in 10'
cube increments. The dirt is only moved to just
around the opening of the excavation. If desired, the
caster can dig a trench, or dig straight down. If digging
straight down, there is a cumulative probability
that the walls of the pit will collapse, depending on
the following medium: soil, 15% per 5'; mud, 55%;
sand, 35%. Any being that comes within 1' of the
opening of a pit must make a save versus Paralyzation
to avoid falling in. If a pit is excavated just in
front of a fast moving being, it is entitled to a saving
throw versus Magic to avoid falling in. If a pit is
excavated directly under a stationary creature, it will
automatically fall in.



Dimension Door
Page: 100
Magic-User Level 4
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: 10'
This is a minor version of the Teleport spell, allowing
the caster to instantly transfer the subject
from its current location to any other known spot
within 360'. The being always arrives at exactly the
spot desired by the caster. Unwilling subjects are
granted a saving throw versus Magic. An unknown
or unseen place can be specified; for example, 100'
south and 20' high, but if the destination is already
occupied by a solid body, the spell fails.



Disintegrate
Page: 100
Magic-User Level 6
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: 120'
This spell undoes the bonds of creation that
keep a single creature or object together. Up to a
10' × 10' × 10' cube of material is entirely disintegrated,
leaving behind no evidence that it ever
existed.



Dispel Evil
Page: 100
Cleric Level 5
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: 30'
Through the magnificence of the most holy powers
of the universe, all summoned or other enchanted
creatures within 30' of the caster must succeed in a
saving throw versus Magic or be destroyed. Even if
the saving throw is made, any creature that would
otherwise have been banished will suffer a penalty
of –7 to hit the caster for the next 6 Turns.

Magic-Users and others with prepared spells
(but not Clerics) must make a saving throw for
every prepared spell, and a failure means that that
spell is lost until prepared again. Creatures affected
by this spell include, but are certainly not limited to,
demons, familiars, and elementals.



Dispel Magic
Page: 100
Cleric Level 3
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: 120'
Magic is unnatural and unwanted in the intended
order of things. This spell empowers the proper
forces of existence to expel the foul energies known
as magic as if they never were. The spell affects a 20'
cubic area. All spells in that area that are currently
in effect are automatically negated. If cast on the
same Segment in combat as a spell from an enemy
combatant, Dispel Magic can be used to disrupt and
negate that spell.

Monsters with magical ability or able to create
magical effects (including Elves, but not Magic-
Users) lose the ability to use these powers for 2d6
Turns if they are within the area of effect and fail a
saving throw versus Magic.

All magical items within the area of effect are
temporarily disenchanted. They regain their
enchantment after 2d6 Turns. If the caster casts
Dispel Magic as a touch effect, then any item so
touched is permanently disenchanted.
Dispel Magic negates magical curses or diseases
for 2d6 Turns only.



Dispel Magic
Page: 101
Magic-User Level 3
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: 120'
As a Magic-User grows in knowledge and power, he
becomes able to dismiss magic as well as conjure
it. This spell empowers the proper forces of existence
to expel the foul energies known as magic as
if they never were. The spell affects a 20' cubic area.
All spells in that area that are currently in effect are
automatically negated. If cast on the same Segment
in combat as a spell from an enemy combatant,
Dispel Magic can be used to disrupt and negate that
spell.

All magical items within the area of effect are
temporarily disenchanted. They regain their
enchantment after 2d6 Turns, but one-use items
such as potions and scrolls (but not spellbooks) are
permanently nullified.

There is one important exception—a Magic-User’s
Dispel Magic has no effect on Cleric spells.
Dispel Magic negates magical curses or diseases
for 2d6 Turns only.



Divination
Page: 101
Cleric Level 4
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: 0
The Divine powers know everything that was,
everything that is, and everything that will be. This
spell allows the Cleric to distract his god with his
resplendent devotion and allow some of the god’s
knowledge to slip into the world. The Cleric can
then interpret those memories to gain information
regarding an area, building, area of a dungeon, or
other similar place.

Information gained includes, in vague terms,
a general idea of how powerful the creatures are
there present, the general amount of treasure present,
what kind of resistance to attack is present, and
the nature of it, whether it is good, evil, chaotic,
lawful, etc. The base chance for a correct divination
is 60%+1% per caster level. The Referee should roll
this secretly. If the dice roll fails, false information
is delivered.



Duo-Dimension
Page: 101
Magic-User Level 7
Duration: 1 Round/level
Range: 0
This spell banishes the depth dimension of the caster’s
three dimensions of being, thus reducing the
visible portion of himself to the two-dimensional
aspects of height and width. The caster can take all
normal actions, but has the ability to appear invisible
if standing such that only his side is presented
to an observer. The caster can also slide sideways
through small cracks or other tight spaces. True
seeing does allow a viewer to see the caster. This
two-dimensional existence also creates a vulnerability
in the caster. Any damage that the caster sustains
while under the effects of the spell is multiplied
by three, but the character cannot be struck while
standing sideways to an attacker. The caster can,
however, be affected by area effect attacks, which are
subject to the damage multiplier stated previously.



Earthquake
Page: 102
Cleric Level 7
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: 120'
The wrath of divine power is a terrible thing to
behold, and this spell allows the Cleric to command
this wrath and unleash it against his enemies! An
intense, but highly localized tremor rips the ground,
to a diameter of 5' per caster level. The shock collapses
structures, opens cracks in the ground, and
more. The effect lasts for 1 Round, during which
time creatures on the ground cannot move, cast
spells, or attack. The earthquake affects all terrain,
vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area. The
specific effect of an earthquake spell depends on the
nature of the terrain where it is cast.

See book for details



Enlarge
Page: 102
Magic-User Level 1
Duration: 1 Turn/level
Range: 5'/level
The forces of magic do not recognize the relationships
of size and distance between things; it is the
limitations of the mind’s ability to master magic that
results in strictures such as “spell range,” but sometimes
the infinite nature of magic can be applied to
material objects. This spell causes instant growth
(and corresponding increase in weight and damage
done) of a single object or creature that is in visible
range. This increase changes a creature’s size by
20% per caster level, up to three times the original
size of the creature. The effectiveness of this spell
is half of this on non-living objects, which are only
enlarged 10% per level and to a maximum of double
the original size of the object. The caster can affect
a 10' cube of living matter per level or a 5' cube per
level of non-living matter.

See book for details



Enthrall
Page: 102
Cleric Level 2
Duration: See Below
Range: 100'
When one’s voice is given divine authority, it will be
listened to. This spell allows the Cleric to hold the
attention of a crowd and possibly to influence that
crowd. Any non-hostile beings within 100' will stop
what they are doing to listen to the Cleric speak.

The Cleric can compel a crowd to action. If the
Cleric attempts to persuade the crowd to do something
that they are already inclined to do, they will
act if they fail a saving throw versus Magic (just
because they want to do something, it does not necessarily
make it a good idea, otherwise they would
already have done it). If the Cleric attempts to persuade
the crowd to do something that offends their
sensibilities, they will attack the Cleric if they fail
their saving throw.

The spell ends immediately if any of the subjects
of the spell are attacked or harmed in any way,
if there is a powerful distraction that breaks the
crowd's attention, or if the Cleric stops speaking to
them.



ESP
Page: 103
Magic-User Level 2
Duration: 1 Turn
Range: 60'
If you know how to listen, thoughts are as audible
as any voice, and those who care not about the privacy
of all living things can hear them. This spell
allows the Magic-User to perceive the thoughts of
one character within 60' of him at a time. The caster
understands the meaning of all thoughts even if he
does not share the person’s language. The ability
to hear thoughts is obstructed by rock 2' thick or
greater, or any amount of lead.



Explosive Runes
Page: 103
Magic-User Level 3
Duration: Permanent until triggered
Range: Touch
Magic-Users are miserly and jealous people, guarding
their secrets as if they can take them to the
grave. These runes are traced by a caster upon a
book, map, scroll, or similar object bearing written
information. The runes detonate when read, dealing
2d6 points of damage in a 10' radius. The reader suffers
full damage, no save allowed. Anyone else in the
area of effect takes the full damage unless a saving
throw versus Magic is made for half damage. The
object on which the runes were written is obliterated,
unless it is unaffected by fire. The caster and
any other beings specifically instructed can read
the protected writing without triggering the runes.
Likewise, the caster can remove the runes whenever
desired. Another creature can remove them with a
successful casting of the Dispel Magic spell. A Magic-
User has a 5% chance per level of detecting the
runes while a Specialist has a flat 5% chance.



Extension
Page: 103
Magic-User Level 4
Duration: See Below
Range: 0
This spell reminds magic forces that it is not bound
by natural time and so lengthens the duration of
another spell previously cast by the Magic-User by
50%. The previous spell must still be active.



Faerie Fire
Page: 103
Magic-User Level 1
Duration: 2 Rounds/level
Range: 80'
A pale glow surrounds and outlines the subjects,
making them hypervisible. Outlined subjects shed
light that makes them visible in darkness at a distance
of 80', or half this if the creatures are near a
light source. The Magic-User can affect creatures
within a 40' radius, and may outline up to one
human-sized creature per caster level. The Faerie
Fire can be blue, green, or violet, according to the
Magic-User’s choice at the time of casting. The
Faerie Fire does not cause any harm to the objects
or creatures thus outlined. However, their greater
visibility grants attackers a +2 bonus to hit them
while the spell is in effect.



Faithful Hound
Page: 104
Magic-User Level 5
Duration: 1 Round/level
Range: 10'
This spell summons a guardian spirit to act as a
guard dog for a particular area. This spirit is invisible
to all but the caster. The area must be close to
the caster, however, for if the caster is more than 30'
from the area the spirit guards, it will return to the
outer realm. The spirit can detect virtually any creature
that enters the area: it can detect invisibility,
can see creatures that are moving between dimensions,
and can detect virtually any other method
that might be employed to sneak into an area. If any
creature larger than a cat or small dog enters the
area, the spirit will begin howling with its echoing,
supernatural bay. Moreover, it will seek to attack
intruders from behind (it does not make frontal
assaults) and can attack as a monster of 10 Hit Dice
for 3d6 damage, even if the opponent requires up
to a +3 magical weapon to be hit. It has AC 19 and
cannot be harmed by normal weapons.



False Alignment
Page: 104
Magic-User Level 3
Duration: 1 Turn/level
Range: 0
This spell masks the caster’s true alignment. For all
intents and purposes, not to mention spell effects,
the caster will be considered to have a Neutral alignment
for the duration of this spell.



Feather Fall
Page: 104
Magic-User Level 1
Duration: See Below
Range: 10'/level
The affected creatures or objects in range fall slowly.
Feather Fall instantly changes the rate at which the
targets fall to that of a feather (about 5' per Round),
and the subjects take no damage upon landing while
the spell is in effect. The spell ends immediately
when the subject stops falling.

The spell can affect one or more objects or creatures,
including gear and carried objects up to each
creature’s maximum encumbrance. The maximum
volume is a 10' cube, and 200 pounds + 200 pounds
per level can also be affected, such that a 1st level
Magic-User can affect 400 pounds.

The spell can be cast with an instant utterance,
quickly enough to save the caster or another
creature if he unexpectedly falls, but Initiative, if
appropriate, must be on the side of the caster. The
spell can be cast on falling items or creatures and
missiles, but is ineffective against creatures firmly on
the ground or flying. No saving throw is permitted.



Feeblemind
Page: 104
Magic-User Level 5
Duration: Permanent
Range: 120'
This spell turns the neural pathways of the target into
a superconducting network of thought. In most targets,
this overloads their brain. If the target creature
fails a saving throw versus Magic (with a –4 penalty!),
it becomes a mental invalid. The affected creature is
unable to speak, cast spells, understand language,
or communicate coherently. The subject remains in
this state until a Dispel Magic or Remove Curse spell is
used to cancel the effect of the Feeblemind.

However, if the target succeeds with his saving
throw, he is considered to be under the effect of a
Haste spell for as many Rounds as the caster has
levels.



Find the Path
Page: 105
Cleric Level 6
Duration: 1 Turn/level
Range: Touch
The recipient of this spell can find the shortest,
most direct physical route to a specified destination,
whether into or out of a locale. The locale can
be outdoors, underground, or even inside a Maze
spell. Find the Path works with respect to locations,
not objects or creatures at a locale. The spell enables
the subject to sense the correct direction that will
eventually lead it to its destination, indicating,
at appropriate times, the exact path to follow or
physical actions to take. The spell ends when the
destination is reached, or the duration expires,
whichever comes first. Find the Path can be used to
remove the subject from the effect of a Maze spell
in a single Round.

Lose the Path (the reverse of Find the Path)
renders a touched being completely incapable of
finding its way.



Floating Disc
Page: 105
Magic-User Level 1
Duration: 6 Turns
Range: 20'
The caster creates a slightly concave, circular plane
of force that follows him about and carries a heavy
load for him. The disk is 3 feet in diameter and 1
inch deep at its center. It can hold 500 pounds. If
used to transport a liquid, its capacity is 2 gallons.
The disk floats approximately 3 feet above the
ground at all times and remains level. It floats along
horizontally within spell range and will accompany
the caster with an equal movement rate. If not otherwise
directed, it maintains a constant interval of
6' between itself and the caster, and will follow the
caster without prompting to maintain a minimum
of 6' distance. When the disk winks out at the end
of the spell’s duration, whatever it was supporting
falls to the surface beneath it.



Fly
Page: 105
Magic-User Level 3
Duration: d6 Turns + 1 Turn/level
Range: Touch
For a number of Turns equal to the caster’s level
+1d6 Turns, the caster can fly with a maximum
movement of 120' each Round. The caster can vary
the speed as desired, and is capable of hovering.



Forbiddance
Page: 105
Cleric Level 6
Duration: Permanent
Range: 120'
Forbiddance seals a 60' square area against all planar
travel, either into or out of it, or within it. This
includes all teleportation spells (such as Dimension
Door and Teleport), plane shifting, astral travel,
and all summoning spells. Such effects simply fail
automatically.



Force of Forbidment
Page: 105
Magic-User Level 2
Duration: 1 Turn/level or until concentration lapses
Range: 120'
The caster can block one subject of less than 6 Hit
Dice from being able to advance past a certain point,
the subject being blocked by a wall of magical force.
A saving throw versus Magic applies, but at –2. The
caster must maintain concentration thereafter in
order to continue blocking the creature. Missiles
will penetrate the magical force, and can do so in
either direction. However, magical arrows are disenchanted
if they pass through the barrier.



Forget
Page: 106
Magic-User Level 2
Duration: Permanent
Range: 30'
This spell allows the caster to obliterate the memory
of an opponent. The time span is equal to the previous
1 Round, +1 Round per 3 levels of the caster.
This spell only affects memory, it does not alter any
actual events that have taken place or nullify any
other spell effects. The spell is capable of affecting
up to 4 beings in range who are allowed a saving
throw versus Magic, which is modified depending
on how many creatures are targeted. No modifier is
applied if 3 or 4 creatures are targeted, but if 2 are
targeted the save is at –1, and –2 if only one being
is targeted.



Gaseous Form
Page: 106
Magic-User Level 3
Duration: 1 minute/level
Range: Touch
The subject, but not his gear, becomes insubstantial,
shapeless, misty, and translucent. The character
cannot touch or affect material objects, nor pass
through solid objects or cast spells while in gaseous
form.

A gaseous creature floats at a 10' movement rate.
It can pass through small holes or narrow openings,
even mere cracks, as long as the spell persists.
The creature is subject to the effects of wind, and it
cannot enter water or other liquid.
The subject must be willing for the spell to take
effect. The subject, not the caster, can decide to
end the spell before the duration runs out. When
regaining physical form, the subject can do so into
an empty set of clothes and/or suit of armor.



Geas
Page: 106
Magic-User Level 6
Duration: See Below
Range: Touch
The whims of a proficient wizard are not often
ignored. This spell forces its victim, if a saving throw
versus Magic is failed, into performing one service
specified by the wizard. This service can be a lengthy
quest or an immediate action, almost anything the
wizard desires as long as it is a definite action. The
wizard cannot, however, order the victim to harm
himself deliberately. The victim retains his own wits
and faculties, but must make the wizard's service his
top priority at all times else fall under the effects of
a curse as specified by the Magic-User. The only
way to remove the curse is to complete the service,
and when that service has been performed the spell
terminates.



Glass Eye
Page: 106
Magic-User Level 6
Duration: 1 Round/level
Range: Touch
The caster of this spell is able to see through walls as
if a 3' square window is present. For the duration of
the spell, the caster can see through more than just
one wall, but it takes one Round to switch from one
wall to another. The arcane window, according to
the caster’s preference, can be made visible to other
creatures. However, if it is made visible to others
it can only be applied to one wall. The window is
always one way. The spell can be applied to 20' thick
wood, 6' thick stone, or 4 inch thick metal. Platinum,
gold, and lead block this spell.



Globe of Invulnerability, Major
Page: 106
Magic-User Level 6
Duration: 1 Round/level
Range: 0
An immobile, faintly shimmering magical 10' diameter
sphere surrounds the caster and excludes all
Magic-User spell effects of 4th level or lower. The
area or effect of any such spells does not include
the area of the Major Globe of Invulnerability. Such
spells fail to affect any target located within the
globe. However, any type of spell can be cast out
of the magical globe. Spells of 5th level and higher
are not affected by the globe, nor are spells already
in effect when the globe is cast. The globe can be
brought down by a Dispel Magic spell.



Globe of Invulnerability, Minor
Page: 107
Magic-User Level 4
Duration: 1 Round/level
Range: 0
An immobile, faintly shimmering magical 10' diameter
sphere surrounds the caster and excludes all
Magic-User spell effects of 3rd level or lower. The
area or effect of any such spells does not include
the area of the Minor Globe of Invulnerability. Such
spells fail to affect any target located within the
globe. However, any type of spell can be cast out
of the magical globe. Spells of 4th level and higher
are not affected by the globe, nor are spells already
in effect when the globe is cast. The globe can be
brought down by a Dispel Magic spell.



Grasping Hand
Page: 107
Magic-User Level 7
Duration: 1 Round/level
Range: 10'/level
A Grasping Hand can automatically grapple one
opponent who fails their saving throw versus Paralyzation.
Once he fails his saving throw, he will be
held fast for the duration of the spell, and can be
moved as the caster wishes at a movement rate of
60'. The “hand” has no physical form, so there is no
way for allies to pry the “hand” loose and it will not
block attacks made against the restrained creature.



Gust of Wind
Page: 107
Magic-User Level 3
Duration: 1 Round
Range: 10'/level
This spell summons forth a powerful blast of air,
forceful enough to blow out unprotected flames.
The wind is strong enough to hurl a small flying
creature backwards by 1d6 × 10', and will hold
medium-sized creatures back from moving.



Hallucinatory Terrain
Page: 107
Magic-User Level 4
Duration: Permanent
Range: 240'
The caster makes some terrain look, sound, and
smell like another sort of terrain, but the entire
terrain to be hidden must be encompassed by the
range that this spell can affect. The caster can affect
a 10' square area per caster level.



Haste
Page: 107
Magic-User Level 3
Duration: 1 Round/level
Range: 60'
This spell makes creatures move and act more
quickly than normal. One creature per caster level
within a diameter of 60' can be affected. A Hasted
creature can make double the normal number of
actions and automatically wins Initiative (effectively
going on Segment 7). All of the Hasted creature’s
modes of movement (including land movement,
burrow, climb, fly, and swim) double in speed. Multiple
Haste effects do not stack. Only one spell can
be cast per Round while hasted.

Haste dispels and counters Slow effects.

Slow, the reverse of Haste, halves all attacks and
movement, including spell casting such that only
one spell can be cast every two Rounds.



Heal
Page: 107
Cleric Level 6
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: Touch
Heal enables the caster to channel divine energy
into a creature to wipe away injury and afflictions.
It immediately ends any and all of the following
adverse conditions affecting the target: blindness,
disease, fatigue, Feeblemind, and poison. It heals all
but 1d4 points of damage.

Harm (reverse of Heal) takes away all, but 1d4
Hit Points from the victim touched and inflicts a
disease as per the spell Cause Disease.



Heat Metal
Page: 108
Cleric Level 2
Duration: 7 Rounds
Range: 40'
Those who would dare take up arms against the
gods' chosen shall burn. This spell targets one opponent
and causes all metal arms and armor (including
impromptu weapons!) to become hot enough to
burn flesh. As insurance against hypocrisy, the caster's
arms and armor heats up as well.

On the first Round of the spell, the metal
becomes warm and uncomfortable to touch, but
deals no damage. The same effect also occurs on
the last Round of the spell's duration. During the
second (and also the next-to-last) Round, intense
heat causes pain and damage. In the third, fourth,
and fifth Rounds, the metal is searing hot, causing
more damage.

See book for details



Heroism
Page: 108
Cleric Level 2
Duration: 1 Round/level
Range: Touch
This spell grants the subject 1d4 levels’ worth of Hit
Points and saving throws (and, for Fighters, Attack
Bonus) for the duration of the spell.
When the spell ends, if the subject has more Hit
Points than when the spell was cast, his Hit Points
return to their previous level. If the subject has less
than or equal the number of Hit Points, then there
is no adjustment once the spell ends.



Hold Monster
Page: 108
Magic-User Level 5
Duration: 1 Round/level
Range: 120'
This spell will render any living creature paralyzed.
Targets of the spell are aware, and can breathe normally,
but cannot take actions of any kind, including
speech. A successful save versus Paralyzation will
negate the effect. The spell can be cast at a single
monster, which makes its save at –2, or at a group, in
which case 1d4 of the creatures in the group can be
affected and their save is not made at a penalty.

A winged creature which is paralyzed cannot flap
its wings and falls (if it is in flight at the time). A
paralyzed swimmer cannot swim and may drown.

If a magic item or spell operates to partially
negate the effects of paralysis, failure on the saving
throw will have the effect of a Slow spell rather than
completely immobilizing the target.



Hold Person
Page: 108
Magic-User Level 3
Duration: 2 Rounds/level
Range: 120'
This spell projects a mystic force (unique to each
formulation of the spell; different forms must be
researched and prepared separately) that paralyzes
living human and human-like targets (but not
Elves). A successful save versus Paralyzation will
negate the effect.

The spell can be cast at a single target which
makes its save at –2, or at a group, in which case
1d3+1 targets can be affected and their save is not
made at a penalty. Only humans or humanlike
beings are affected. Characters of a greater level than
the Magic-User are unaffected, as are undead and
mindless creatures. Victims of the spell are aware,
and breathe normally, but cannot take actions of
any kind, including speech.

A winged creature which is paralyzed cannot flap
its wings and falls (if it is in flight at the time). A
paralyzed swimmer cannot swim and may drown.

If a magic item or spell operates to partially
negate the effects of paralysis, failure on the saving
throw will have the effect of a Slow spell rather than
completely immobilizing the target.



Hold Portal
Page: 109
Magic-User Level 1
Duration: 2d6 Turns
Range: 10'
This spell magically holds shut a door, gate, window,
or shutter of wood, metal, or stone. The magic
affects the portal just as if it were securely closed
and normally locked. A Knock spell or a successful
Dispel Magic spell can negate a Hold Portal spell.



Holy Word
Page: 109
Cleric Level 7
Duration: See Below
Range: 0
The language of gods is not one for mortal ears. In
fact, it is the speaking of these words that is behind
the power of Clerical magic. Some words though,
are more devastating than others. The most destructive
word is the true name of the Cleric’s god,
spoken as the god would speak it. The intonation of
this Holy Word utterly banishes creatures not native
to the caster’s plane, hurling them back to their
respective planes of existence. Additionally, other
creatures will suffer effects from the Holy Word in
accordance with the creature’s Hit Dice.

See book for details



Howl of the Moon
Page: 110
Magic-User Level 3
Duration: 1 hour/level (× 2 during full moon)
Range: Touch
The Magic-User summons the primal self that
exists within all humanity. However, he can only
do so at night, when the chaotic forces of the moon
tug at the savage psyche. The subject of the spell
will abandon both reason and the façade of civilization,
tearing at his clothes until he appears as a
naked raving mad man. The transformation takes
a full Turn to take effect. Once complete, he will
move with the speed and nimbleness of a wolf
(180' movement rate). His senses also become
heightened and he is able to eat raw meat with
no ill effects. His savage attacks are +2 to hit and
he inflicts 1d6 damage with nothing but his bare
hands and teeth. This is not due to any actual physical
transformation, as the outward appearance
remains unchanged. If the subject is attacked during
the transformation, he will attempt to either flee or
defend himself with the above bonuses.

See book for details.



Identify
Page: 110
Magic-User Level 1
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: Touch
This spell allows the Magic-User to discern the
magical properties of an item. The spell requires
one uninterrupted day in a laboratory worth at least
1,000 sp to cast. At the end of the day, the Magic-
User will have successfully determined one magical
property of an item. The character will not know if
there are additional properties unless he casts Identify
again and another magical property of the item
is determined. He will only know all of the magical
properties of an item when he casts the spell and
no new property is identified; both the “wasted”
day and the “wasted” casting of Identify confirming
that the item has no further properties. Note that a
cursed item will not be identified as cursed, but as
the item it pretends to be. This spell does not reveal
command words. Each casting of the spell, successful
or not, requires the expenditure of 100 sp worth
of ingredients.



Imprisonment
Page: 110
Magic-User Level 9
Duration: Permanent
Range: Touch
When the caster casts Imprisonment and touches
a creature, if it fails a saving throw versus Magic it
is entombed in a state of suspended animation in
a small sphere far beneath the surface of the earth.
The subject remains there unless a Freedom spell
(the reverse of Imprisonment) is cast at the locale
where the imprisonment took place. Magical search
by a crystal ball, a Locate Object spell, or some other
similar divination does not reveal the fact that the
creature has been imprisoned.



Insect Plague
Page: 110
Cleric Level 5
Duration: 1 Turn/level
Range: 360'
The caster summons a swarm of locusts in a 60'
diameter. The swarm causes creatures occupying
its area to flee if they are 2 or less Hit Dice. This
spell does not function when cast underground.
The caster can control the swarm to move 20' in a
Round. The caster must concentrate for the duration
of the spell to maintain control over the swarm,
and if the swarm leaves the range the caster loses
control of it. The caster also loses control of the
swarm if he is successfully attacked.



Instant Summons
Page: 111
Magic-User Level 7
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: See Below
Time and space do not exist to the forces of magic,
and this spell allows the Magic-User to disregard
both in limited circumstances. When the spell is
cast, a prepared item is summoned (instantly!) to
his hands from wherever it currently is. To prepare
the item, the caster simply places a magical mark on
the item. The item must not be more than roughly 3'
long nor weigh more than 8 pounds. Then the spell
is cast, which magically and invisibly inscribes the
name of the item on a gem worth at least 1,000 sp.
Thereafter, the caster can summon the item by
speaking a special word (set by the caster when
the spell is cast) and crushing the gem. The item
appears instantly in the caster’s hand. Only the
caster can use the gem in this way. If the item is in
the possession of another creature, the spell does
not work. The item can be summoned from across
the multiverse, but only if no other creature has
claimed ownership of it in the meantime.



Interposing Hand
Page: 111
Magic-User Level 5
Duration: 1 Round/level
Range: 10'/level
Interposing Hand creates a large magic hand that
appears between the caster and one opponent. This
floating, disembodied hand then moves to remain
between the two, regardless of where the caster
moves or how the opponent tries to get around it.
The hand does not pursue an opponent, however.
An Interposing Hand has as many Hit Points as the
caster when undamaged. It has an AC of 12. Any
creature weighing 2,000 pounds or less that tries
to push past the hand is slowed to half its normal
speed.



Invisibility
Page: 111
Magic-User Level 2
Duration: 1 Turn/level
Range: Touch
With this spell the Magic-User frightens the light of
the world, causing it to avoid the subject of the spell.
This causes the subject, including all carried equipment,
to completely vanish from sight. Equipment
that is dropped becomes visible, and items picked
up disappear. Light sources carried by the subject
cannot be seen by others, but can be seen by the
subject.

The subject still makes noise, emits odor, etc., as
usual. The subject still has physical mass and can
touch and be touched. If the subject makes any sort
of offensive action, such as attacking someone, tripping
someone, using force to break an object, setting
fire to a structure, basically taking any violent action
at all, that action enrages the world’s light so much
that it attempts to attack the subject, resulting in
the invisibility being dispelled just after the violent
deed is performed. Note that being successful in
a violent deed is not necessary; an invisible character
that attacks and misses a target still becomes
visible.



Invisibility 10' Radius
Page: 111
Magic-User Level 3
Duration: 1 Turn/level
Range: 10' Radius Area
The caster’s rage is so great that the light is terrified
on a grand scale, and any beings, and their carried
equipment, within 10' of the caster at the time of
the casting become invisible as per the Invisibility
spell. After the spell is cast, those affected do not
have to remain close to the caster; it is as if individual
Invisibility spells had been cast on each of them.



Invisibility, Improved
Page: 112
Magic-User Level 4
Duration: 1 Turn/level
Range: Touch
With this spell the Magic-User frightens the light of
the world, causing it to avoid the subject of the spell.
This causes the subject, including all carried equipment,
to completely vanish from sight. Equipment
that is dropped becomes visible, and items picked
up disappear. Light sources carried by the subject
cannot be seen by others, but can be seen by the
subject.

The subject still makes noise, emits odor, etc.,
as usual. The subject still has physical mass and
can touch and be touched. However, this spell is
also proof against the anger of the light, and so the
subject can take any aggressive or offensive action
desired and it will not cancel the spell.



Invisibility, Mass
Page: 112
Magic-User Level 7
Duration: 1 Turn/level
Range: 10'/level
This spell is identical to the Invisibility 10' Radius
spell, but all living things (and their equipment) in
a 30' square area become invisible. After the spell
is cast, those affected do not have to remain within
this area; it is as if individual Invisibility spells have
been cast on each of them.



Invisibility to Undead
Page: 112
Cleric Level 1
Duration: 1 Turn/level
Range: Touch
The subject of this spell becomes completely unnoticed
by undead creatures for the duration of the
spell. Undead creatures cannot see, hear, or smell
the subject at all for the duration of the spell or until
the subject does something to intentionally gain an
undead creature’s attention (including attacking).
This breaks the spell completely, with all undead in
the area being then able to sense the subject.

The reverse of this spell, Undead Attraction,
causes all present undead to ignore all living beings
other than the subject until the subject is dead or
until one of the ignored beings attacks the undead.



Knock
Page: 112
Magic-User Level 2
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: 60'
This spell allows the Magic-User to speak to a stuck,
barred, locked, Held, or Wizard Locked door and
convince it to open for him. It opens secret doors,
as well as locked or trick-opening boxes and chests.
It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains (provided
they serve to hold shut something which can be
opened). If used to open a Wizard Locked door, the
spell does not remove the Wizard Lock, but simply
suspends its functioning for one Turn. In all other
cases, the door does not relock itself or become
stuck again on its own. Knock will not raise a portcullis
or operate any other similar mechanism, nor
will it affect ropes, vines, and the like. Each spell can
undo a single means of preventing access.



Legend Lore
Page: 112
Magic-User Level 6
Duration: See Below
Range: 0
The works and deeds of the famous and the infamous
are witnessed by the universe, and all secrets
are spied upon by creation, even if there is no man
to record them. This spell allows the caster to read
this chronicle that is written between the strands of
reality, giving him knowledge about an important
person, place, or thing. If the person or thing is at
hand, or if the caster is in the place in question,
the casting time is 1d4 × 10 Turns. If the caster has
only detailed information on the person, place, or
thing, the casting time is 1d10 days. If only rumors
are known, the casting time is 2d6 weeks. During
the casting, the Magic-User cannot engage in other
than routine activities such as eating, sleeping, and
so forth. When completed, the divination brings
legends or information about the person, place, or
things to mind, but always in the form of riddles,
puzzles, symbols, or other obscure forms that must
be reasoned or intuited to understand. If the person,
place, or thing is not of legendary importance, no
information is gained.



Levitate
Page: 113
Magic-User Level 2
Duration: See Below
Range: 20'
Levitate allows the caster to move himself, another
creature, or an object up and down as desired. An
unwilling creature can make a saving throw versus
Magic to avoid the effects, and an object must be
unattended or the possessor is allowed a saving
throw if he so wishes. By concentrating, the caster
can mentally direct the recipient to move up or
down as much as 20' each Round. The caster cannot
move the recipient horizontally, but the recipient
could clamber along the face of a cliff, for example,
or push against a ceiling to move laterally (generally
at half his normal land speed). The spell lasts as long
as the caster actively concentrates on it. If the Magic-
User moves, engages in combat, is damaged, or
takes any other action, the spell ends immediately.



Light
Page: 113
Magic-User Level 1
Duration: 3 Turns/caster level
Range: 120'
This spell creates a light source equivalent to that
of a torch in the target area of the spell. The effect is
immobile if cast on an area, but if cast on an object
it moves with the object. Once cast, the caster has
no control over the light, but can end the spell if he
so wishes. If cast on a person or on the equipment
of a person who does not wish to be the target of the
spell, that person is allowed a saving throw versus
Magic; success means that the spell is cast on the
area the person is in, but not on a particular object.

The light caused by the spell emits no heat, nor
can it be extinguished by water or high winds. The
source of the light can be covered, which will block
the light, but this will not end the spell.

Darkness, the reverse of the spell causes an area
to be covered in total darkness; even creatures able
to see in the dark are blind here.

The spell can be targeted at a creature’s eyes specifically
to blind it, assuming it has eyes in close
proximity to one another. The target gets a saving
throw versus Magic. If successful, the spell fails to
work at all.



Light, Continual
Page: 113
Magic-User Level 2
Duration: 1 day
Range: 120'
This spell creates a light source equivalent to that
of a torch in the target area of the spell. The effect is
immobile if cast on an area, but if cast on an object
it moves with the object. Once cast, the caster has
no control over the light, but can end the spell if he
so wishes. If cast on a person or on the equipment
of a person who does not wish to be the target of the
spell, that person is allowed a saving throw versus
Magic; success means the spell is cast on the area
the person is in, but not on a particular object.

The light caused by the spell emits no heat, nor
can it be extinguished by water or high winds. The
source of the light can be covered, which will block
the light, but this will not end the spell.

Continual Darkness, the reverse of the spell causes
an area to be covered in total darkness; even creatures
able to see in the dark are blind here.

The spell can be targeted at a creature’s eyes specifically
to blind it, assuming it has eyes in close
proximity to one another. The target gets a saving
throw versus Magic. If successful, the spell fails to
work at all.



Locate Object
Page: 114
Magic-User Level 2
Duration: 1 Turn/level
Range: 60' + 10'/level
The caster can sense the direction of a well-known
or clearly visualized object. The caster can search
for general items, in which case the nearest one of
its kind is located. Attempting to find a certain item
requires a specific and accurate mental image; if the
image is not close enough to the actual object, the
spell fails. Living creatures or animate constructs
cannot be located using Locate Object.

The reverse of this spell, Hide Object, makes the
location of one object (which must be touched
at the time of casting) completely unknown and
unknowable to anyone not able to directly sense it
(through sight, hearing, smell, etc.) for the duration
of the spell.



Lucubration
Page: 114
Magic-User Level 6
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: 0
This spell captures the energy of a previously cast
spell and restores it to the caster. Any one spell of
5th level or lower cast within the past 24 hours is
again fully prepared and ready to cast.



Magic Aura
Page: 114
Magic-User Level 1
Duration: Permanent
Range: Touch
This spell makes an object appealing to the microcosmic
forces of magic, giving the item an aura
that causes it to register to Detect spells (and spells
with similar capabilities) as though it were magical.
If the object bearing Magic Aura is physically
examined (touched), the examiner recognizes
that the aura is false if he succeeds in a saving
throw versus Magic. Otherwise, he believes the
aura, but no amount of testing reveals what the
true magic is.

The reverse of this spell, Obscure Aura, hides the
magic aura of a legitimate magical item. A Magic-
User casting Detect Magic and actually handling the
item is permitted a saving throw versus Magic to see
the magical aura of the item.



Magic Jar
Page: 114
Magic-User Level 5
Duration: See Below
Range: 10'/level
By casting Magic Jar, the caster places his soul in
a gem or large crystal (known as the magic jar),
leaving his body lifeless. An attempt can then be
made to take control of a body within 120', forcing
its soul into the magic jar. At a later time, the
caster can move back to the jar, thereby returning
the trapped soul to its body, and attempt to possess
another body. The spell ends when the caster sends
his soul back to his own body, leaving the receptacle
empty.

To cast the spell, the magic jar must be within
spell range. While in the magic jar, the caster can
sense and attack any life force. Attempting to possess
a body is a full-Round action. The caster
possesses the body and forces the creature’s soul
into the magic jar unless the subject succeeds a
saving throw versus Magic. Failure to take over the
host leaves the caster’s life force in the magic jar,
and the target automatically succeeds on further
saving throws if the caster attempts to possess its
body again.

See book for details.



Magic Missile
Page: 115
Magic-User Level 1
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: 60' + 10'/level
A missile of magical energy shoots forth from
the caster’s fingertip and strikes its target, dealing
damage equal to 1d4 per level of the caster
(so a second level Magic-User deals 2d4 points of
damage). The missile strikes unerringly, even if the
target is in mêlée combat or has less than total cover
or total concealment. Specific parts of a creature
cannot be singled out.

The caster can throw the full force of the missile
at a single target, but if the caster is 2nd level or
higher, he can choose to divide the dice of damage
between targets as he wishes. Dice must be assigned
to targets before any damage is rolled, and targets of
these divided dice are allowed a saving throw versus
Magic, with success meaning that the target takes
half damage.

Each Magic-User’s Magic Missile is unique in
appearance and always looks the same. When the
caster writes a scroll, the resulting Missile looks
identical to the normally cast version. When using
a scroll written by another Magic-User, or memorizing
a spell out of another’s spellbook, the resulting
spell will look like that other caster’s Missile. Each
different ‘signature’ for a Magic Missile must be
researched and/or transcribed as if it were a different
spell.



Magic Mouth
Page: 115
Magic-User Level 2
Duration: Permanent
Range: See Below
This enchantment is set upon an object, and the
magic is triggered when certain conditions established
by the caster are met. When that happens, a
mouth appears in the object and speaks the message
it has been commanded to speak. The message can
be up to 30 words long.



Magic Sword
Page: 115
Magic-User Level 7
Duration: 1 Round/level
Range: 30'
The caster evokes a magical sword into being and
can wield it by exerting his will. While doing so,
he cannot cast spells, use magic items, or move,
although the spell does not end if the Magic-User’s
concentration is broken; the sword simply does
not attack during that Round. The sword attacks as
a Fighter one-half of the Magic-User’s caster level
(and always hits on a natural 19 or 20), and it can
hit creatures that can ordinarily be hit only with
magic weapons. The sword inflicts 1d12 damage.



Magic Vestment
Page: 115
Cleric Level 3
Duration: 1 Turn/level
Range: Touch
This spell shields the subject by the power of faith,
granting them a +1 Armor Class for every level of
the caster. This spell does not function if the subject
is wearing armor or using any sort of protective
enchantments or items.



Maze
Page: 116
Magic-User Level 8
Duration: See Below
Range: 5'/level
The caster banishes the subject into an extra dimensional
labyrinth. The number of Turns or Rounds
the subject takes to escape this labyrinth is determined
by his Intelligence.
Referees should estimate the targeted Intelligence
of the monster or NPC (if it has no given
stats).

See book for details.



Mending
Page: 116
Magic-User Level 1
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: 30'
Mending repairs small breaks or tears in objects. It
will weld broken metallic objects such as a ring, a
chain link, a medallion, or a slender dagger, providing
but one break exists. Ceramic or wooden objects
with multiple breaks can be invisibly rejoined to be
as strong as new. A hole in a leather sack or a wineskin
is completely healed over by Mending. The
spell cannot repair magic items, nor does it affect
creatures.



Message
Page: 116
Magic-User Level 1
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: 60' + 10'/level
This spell grants the caster the ability to whisper
messages and receive whispered replies. The caster
points his finger at a creature he wants to receive the
message. The target must be in direct line of sight,
with no barrier. The whispered message is audible
only to the target. The creature that receives the
message can whisper a reply that the caster can hear.
The spell transmits sound, not meaning. It does not
transcend language barriers. Unlike casting most
spells, the gestures of this spell are subtle, and it is
easy to conceal that the spell is being cast.



Mind Blank
Page: 116
Magic-User Level 8
Duration: 1 Turn/level
Range: 30'
The subject is protected from all devices and spells
that detect, influence, or read emotions or thoughts.
This spell protects against all mind-affecting spells
and effects as well as information gathering by divination
spells or effects. In the case of scrying that
scans an area the creature is in, such as a crystal ball,
the spell works, but the subject of the Mind Blank
spell is simply not detected. Scrying attempts that
are targeted specifically at the subject do not work
at all.



Mind Switch
Page: 116
Magic-User Level 6
Duration: Permanent
Range: Touch
This spell allows the caster to switch the minds of
two beings. The beings must be of the same race. The
caster must touch the two beings in turn, and when
the second being is touched their minds switch
bodies. A character not wishing to have their mind
switched must make a saving throw versus Magic
to resist the change. If either of the intended targets
succeeds in their saving throw, the spell fails.

Mind-switched characters retain their Charisma,
Intelligence, and Wisdom, gain the Constitution,
Dexterity, and Strength of the body they have been
switched into. The body retains its previous Hit
Point maximum, but the minds otherwise retain
their former class, level, experience points, and
abilities.

The spell is permanent until dispelled. The
caster must touch both involved parties once again
to cancel the spell, and they are each entitled to a
saving throw versus Magic if they want to resist the
spell's cancellation. Casting Dispel Magic allows
no such saving throw. In each case, if the affected
parties are not Dispelled or cancelled at the same
time, the first one to be so affected goes into a consciousless
void until his original body is freed of its
possessing consciousness. If the original body dies
while a mind is in limbo, it is forever lost.



Mirror Image
Page: 117
Magic-User Level 2
Duration: 1 Round/level
Range: 0
This spell grabs 1d4 duplicates of the caster from
near-identical timelines to confuse foes and make
it more difficult for the original caster to come to
harm. Since all of the mirror images are the caster,
in the same situation and fighting the same battle
in their own timeline, they are indistinguishable
in every way from the caster and mimic his every
motion. When an opponent makes a successful
attack against one of the duplicates, it instantly dies
and dissipates into nothingness (the others remain).
If an opponent attempts to attack a Magic-User
obscured by this spell, it is randomly determined
whether the to-hit roll is directed toward the caster
or one of the duplicates. Note that the duplicates do
not take independent action; they are just “mirror
images” as the spell name implies.



Mnemonic Enhancer
Page: 117
Magic-User Level 4
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: 0
This spell allows the caster to prepare additional
spells or retain spells recently cast. Up to 3 levels of
spells could be retained, or memorized above and
beyond the number normally available for the caster’s
level. This can be in any combination of spell
levels. For instance, one 3rd level spell or three 1st
level spells. If spells are to be retained, then rather
than memorize extra spells, Mnemonic Enhancer is
cast first and then used to discharge the spells of
the stated spell levels, while retaining them for one
more casting.



Move Earth
Page: 117
Magic-User Level 6
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: 240'
A 50' cube of loose soil can be moved per Turn
within the spell’s range. Solid stone cannot be
moved.



Neutralize Poison
Page: 117
Cleric Level 4
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: Touch
The caster removes all trace of venom and poison
in the creature or object touched. A poisoned creature
suffers no additional effects from the poison,
and any temporary effects are ended. The spell does
not reverse instantaneous effects such as Hit Point
damage, or other effects that do not go away on their
own. If a character dies of poison, Neutralize Poison
will revive the character if the spell is used no more
than one Turn after death.

The reverse of this spell, Inflict Poison, gives the
caster a poison touch, and the first victim touched
by the Cleric must save versus Poison or die.



Part Water
Page: 117
Cleric Level 7
Duration: 1 Turn/level
Range: 120'
The caster creates a path 10' wide and a maximum of
120' long through water, such as a pond, lake, river,
or other body of water. The caster can dismiss the
spell effects before the duration ends, thus allowing
water to crash down upon unwanted pursuers.



Passwall
Page: 117
Magic-User Level 5
Duration: 3 Turns
Range: 30'
The caster creates a passage through wooden, plaster,
or stone walls, but not through metal or other
harder materials. The passage is 10' deep with a 5'
diameter.



Permanency
Page: 119
Magic-User Level 8
Duration: Permanent
Range: Touch
The Permanency spell makes other spell effects permanent.
It is also used to lock the enchantments
of a magic item permanently into the item, such
magical items, wands, and staves. Certain spells
can be made permanent upon the caster or another
creature, and other spells can be made permanent
only if cast upon an area or an object. Each use of
this spell requires the caster to make a saving throw
versus Magic; failure permanently reduces the caster’s
Constitution by 1 point.

See book for details.



Phantasmal Force
Page: 119
Magic-User Level 2
Duration: 1 Round/level
Range: 10'/level
This spell creates a creature the caster has previously
seen that will obey his every mental command.
However, it only exists in the minds of those seeing,
smelling, or hearing it. The first time a phantasmal
creature causes damage in combat, the victim
receives a saving throw versus Magic. Success means
the creature ceases to exist as far as that character is
concerned and no damage is taken, otherwise, the
illusion is as deadly as any real creature. The illusion
is dispelled the first time it is hit in combat by
someone who believes in it.



Phantasma Psychedelia
Page: 119
Magic-User Level 3
Duration: 1 Round/level
Range: 10'/level
This spell creates a creature the caster has previously
seen that will obey his every mental command.
However, it only exists in the minds of those seeing,
smelling, or hearing it. The first time a phantasmal
creature causes damage in combat, the victim
receives a saving throw versus Magic. Success means
the creature ceases to exist as far as that character is
concerned and no damage is taken, otherwise, the
illusion is as deadly as any real creature. Whenever
the illusory creature is hit in combat by someone
believing in it, the attacker gains another saving
throw to disbelieve the illusion.



Phantasma Supergoria
Page: 119
Magic-User Level 6
Duration: 1 Round/level
Range: 10'/level
This spell creates a creature the caster has previously
seen that will obey his every mental command.
However, it only exists in the minds of those seeing,
smelling, or hearing it. The first time a phantasmal
creature causes damage, the victim receives a saving
throw versus Magic. Success means the creature
ceases to exist as far as that character is concerned
and no damage is taken; otherwise, the illusion is as
deadly as any real creature. If the saving throw is not
made, then another save is allowed only after the
illusory creature has taken so much “damage” that
it must be dead although the illusion can take no
actual damage because it does not exist.
Saving throws are also granted if a character disbelieves
a certain situation created by the illusion.



Phase Door
Page: 120
Magic-User 7
Duration: 1 passage per 2 levels
Range: Touch
This spell creates an ethereal passage through
wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not other materials,
including metals. This passage is 10' deep with
a 5' diameter. The phase door is invisible and inaccessible
to all creatures except the caster, and only
the caster can use the passage. The caster disappears
when entering the phase door and reappears when
exiting. If the caster desires, he can take one other
creature (human-sized or smaller) through the
door. This counts as two uses of the door. The door
does not allow light, sound, or spell effects through
it, nor can it be seen through. A Phase Door is subject
to Dispel Magic. If anyone is within the passage
when it is dispelled, he is harmlessly ejected, the
Referee rolling randomly to see from side of the
Phase Door.



Plant Growth
Page: 120
Magic-User Level 4
Duration: Permanent
Range: 120'
Plant Growth causes normal vegetation (grasses,
bushes, creepers, thistles, trees, vines, etc.) within
range and a 20' square area per level to become
thick and overgrown. The plants entwine to form
a thicket or jungle that creatures must hack or
force a way through. Movement drops to 10', or 20'
for large creatures. The area must have brush and
trees in it for this spell to take effect. At the caster’s
option, the area can be any shape. This spell has no
effect on plant creatures.



Polymorph Any Object
Page: 120
Magic-User Level 8
Duration: Permanent
Range: 5' per level
This transforms one object or creature into another.
Objects can be changed into living creatures, creatures
can be turned to plants, etc. Subjects cannot
be transformed into specific creatures or items—a
rock can be turned into a human, but not into the
king of the realm, for example. Objects transformed
across kingdoms (Plant, Animal, Mineral) cannot
increase mass by more than three times. The spell
Dispel Magic will reverse the effects of this spell. All
objects or creatures affected by this spell will radiate
magic should such detections be made.

This spell can also be used to duplicate the effects
of Flesh to Stone, Stone to Flesh, and similar spells
that alter matter. When this spell is used to create
the effects of Flesh to Stone, the victim makes a
saving throw with a penalty of –4.



Polymorph Others
Page: 121
Magic-User Level 4
Duration: Permanent
Range: 60'
By means of this spell, one living being can be transformed
into another kind of being. The creature
may make a saving throw versus Magic, but if the
creature is willing this roll can be forgone and the
effects are automatic. If the new creature’s Hit Dice
totals more than twice the Hit Dice of the original
creature, the spell does not work. Although the final
form will retain the same number of Hit Points
as the original, all other abilities of the new form
will be acquired, including Intelligence level. The
creature becomes the new creature in every way,
including instincts, alignment, preferences, etc. This
spell cannot be used to reproduce the appearance of
a specific identity. Dispel Magic negates the effects of
this spell, and if the subject dies while in a different
form he will revert to his natural form in death.



Polymorph Self
Page: 121
Magic-User Level 4
Duration: 1 Turn/level
Range: 0
The caster transforms himself into another being. A
particular individual cannot be mimicked with this
spell, but only a typical individual of a creature type.
The new body must be of a creature with a number
of Hit Dice, equal to, or less than that of the caster.
The caster retains his Intelligence, Hit Points, saving
throws, and ability to attack, but does gain physical
abilities of the new form, including Strength or
Strength-based attack forms and damage. Magical
abilities or other special abilities are not gained.
For example, if the caster transforms into a winged
creature, he will be able to fly. If the caster takes the
form of a creature with a petrifying gaze, his gaze
will not petrify. The caster is unable to cast spells
when transformed. Dispel Magic negates the effects
of this spell, and if the caster dies while in a different
form he will revert to his natural form in death.



Power Word Kill
Page: 121
Magic-User Level 9
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: 2.5'/caster level
The caster utters a single word of power that
instantly kills one or more creatures within a 20'
diameter, whether the creatures can hear the word
or not. This spell will kill multiple creatures if they
have less than 11 Hit Points each, or the spell will
kill a single creature that has 60 Hit Points or less.
The caster must choose whether he is attempting to
kill one creature or multiple creatures when he casts
the spell. If multiple creatures are targeted, a maximum
of 120 Hit Points’ total of creatures can be
killed. Any creature that has 61 or more Hit Points
is unaffected by Power Word Kill. There is no saving
throw against this spell.



Power Word Stun
Page: 121
Magic-User Level 7
Duration: See Below
Range: 5'/level
The caster utters a single word of power that
instantly causes one creature of his choice to
become stunned, whether the creature can hear the
word or not. The duration of the spell depends on
the target’s current hit point total. Any creature that
has 91 or more Hit Points is unaffected by Power
Word Stun. There is no saving throw against this
spell.

See book for details.



Prismatic Sphere
Page: 122
Magic-User Level 7
Duration: 1 Turn/level
Range: 0
The caster conjures up an immobile, opaque
globe of shimmering, multicolored light that surrounds
him and offers protection from all forms of
attack. The sphere flashes in all colors of the visible
spectrum. The sphere has a blindness effect
on creatures with less than 8 Hit Dice, which lasts
2d4 Turns.

The caster can pass into and out of the prismatic
sphere and remain near it without harm. However,
the sphere blocks any attempt to project something
into the sphere (including spells). Other creatures
that attempt to attack the caster or pass through
suffer the effects of each color, one at a time in
order. Typically, only the upper hemisphere of the
globe will exist, since the caster is at the center of
the sphere, so the lower half is usually excluded by
the floor surface.

See book for details.



Prismatic Spray
Page: 122
Magic-User Level 7
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: 70'
This spell causes seven shimmering, intertwined,
multicolored beams of light to spray from the
caster’s hand. The beams are intertwined in a fan of
light 70' long, 5' wide at the origin, and 15' wide at
the terminal end. Each beam has a different power.
Creatures in the area of the spell with 8 Hit Dice or
less are automatically blinded for 2d4 Turns. Every
creature in the area is randomly struck by one or
more beams, which have additional effects that are
identical to the same color of the globes produced
by the Magic-User spell Prismatic Sphere.

See book for details.



Prismatic Wall
Page: 122
Magic-User Level 7
Duration: 1 Turn/Level
Range: 10'
Prismatic Wall creates a vertical, opaque wall—a
shimmering, multicolored plane of light that protects
the caster from all forms of attack. For all
purposes this spell functions identically to the Magic-
User spell Prismatic Sphere, except a shimmering
wall is produced rather than an opaque globe.

See book for details.



Projected Image
Page: 122
Magic-User Level 6
Duration: 1 Round/level
Range: 10'/level
The caster creates a quasi-real, illusory version of
himself. The Projected Image looks, sounds, and
smells like the caster, but is intangible. The projected
image mimics the caster’s actions (including
speech) and any sound or spell effects will seem to
come from the image. In fact, ranged spells (not
touch spells) can be cast from the Projected Image
rather than the actual Magic-User! If the image
is physically touched, either by a hand or with a
weapon wielded by hand, it disappears. However,
all missile weapons or spells will pass through the
image or otherwise appear to do nothing to the
caster.



Protection from Evil
Page: 123
Cleric Level 1
Duration: 1 Round/level
Range: Touch
“Evil,” for purposes of this spell, is an in-game colloquial
term. It should properly be called “Protection
from Chaos.”

The subject of this spell becomes more resistant
to Chaotic creatures and effects. Any Chaotic
creature suffers a penalty to hit the subject in
mêlée combat equal to the level of the caster, and
the subject gets a +1 bonus per level of the caster
to save against any attack or effect caused by a
Chaotic creature. Protection from Evil also allows
a saving throw against Magic-User spells and
effects against the subject which normally do not
grant saves (spells which deliver damage do half
on a successful save, other spells fail entirely on
a successful
save), but the subject must also save
against the effects of the beneficial spells he wants
to be cast on him.

See book for details.



Protection from Evil, 10' Radius
Page: 124
Cleric Level 4
Duration: 1 Round/level
Range: 0
“Evil,” for purposes of this spell, is an in-game colloquial
term. It should properly be called “Protection
from Chaos, 10' Radius.”

This spell creates a zone of protection 10' in
radius, centered on and moving with the caster.
Everyone within this zone becomes more resistant
to Chaotic creatures and effects. Any Chaotic
creature suffers a penalty to hit the subject in mêlée
combat equal to the level of the caster, and the subject
gets a +1 bonus per level of the caster to save
against any attack or effect caused by a Chaotic creature.
Protection from Evil also allows a saving throw
against Magic-User spells and effects against the
subject which normally do not grant saves (spells
which deliver damage do half on a successful save,
other spells fail entirely on a successful save), but
the subject must also save against the effects of the
beneficial spells he wants to be cast on him.

See book for details.



Protection from Normal Missiles
Page: 124
Magic-User Level 3
Duration: 1 Round/level
Range: Touch
While under the effects of this spell, the caster
or subject is completely unharmed by small and
non-magical missiles. Only the subject receives
this protection, and it does not extend to large
hurled boulders such as those that giants employ,
or enchanted arrows. The spell conveys no protection
whatsoever against spells, including spells with
missile-like qualities.



Protection from Normal Weapons
Page: 124
Magic-User Level 4
Duration: 1 Round/level
Range: Touch
The subject of this spell becomes completely invulnerable
to the effects of non-magical weapons.
Creatures of 4 Hit Dice or greater, but not including
character levels, are still able to attack as normal if
not using weapons. The spell conveys no protection
whatsoever against spells.



Purify Food and Drink
Page: 125
Cleric Level 1
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: 30'
Enough food and water for up to a dozen people is
made pure, removing all spoilage and poisons.
The reverse of the spell, Foul Food and Drink,
contaminates food and water and will spoil holy
water.



Quest
Page: 125
Cleric Level 5
Duration: See Below
Range: 60'
When this spell is cast on a character, a saving throw
versus Magic is allowed. Success indicates that the
spell is not effective. If the save fails, the caster can
compel the character to take on a quest. This quest
can be dangerous, but the character cannot be
instructed to purposefully harm himself. Should the
affected character resist taking on the quest, he will
be under the effect of a curse, the nature of which is
decided by the Referee. The only way to remove the
curse is to undertake the quest, and when the quest
is finished the spell terminates.



Ray of Enfeeblement
Page: 125
Magic-User Level 2
Duration: 1 Round/level
Range: 20'
When this spell is cast, a coruscating ray shoots
from the caster’s hand. The target of the spell suffers
a penalty to his Strength equal to 25%, +2%
per caster level beyond level 3. This penalty applies
equally to mêlée and missile damage inflicted by an
affected creature as well. A successful saving throw
versus Magic negates the effect.



Read Magic
Page: 125
Magic-User Level 1
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: 0
By means of Read Magic, the caster can decipher
magical inscriptions on objects—books, scrolls,
weapons, and the like—that would otherwise be
unintelligible. This does not normally invoke the
magic contained in the writing, although it can do
so in the case of a cursed scroll. Furthermore, once
the spell is cast and the caster has read the magical
inscription, he thereafter is able to read that particular
writing without recourse to the use of Read
Magic. All spellbooks are written such that only the
Elf or Magic-User who owns the book can decipher
it without the use of this spell. Each casting of the
spell allows the reading of 1d4 items.

If a character loses access to Read Magic (a
spellbook is stolen or destroyed, for instance),
the character must research the spell as if it was
unknown to him and then written up in a new
spellbook.



Remote Surveillance
Page: 125
Magic-User Level 7
Duration: 1 Turn/level
Range: Touch
This spell enables a caster to enchant a particular
item. The first person or creature to handle that item
immediately becomes a conduit for the caster, with
no saving throw. The victim will not realize that he
is the victim of a spell.

When this happens, the caster is immediately
aware of the spell’s activation. The caster can then
experience all of the subject’s senses. In effect, the
subject of the spell becomes the caster’s perfect spy.
The caster can also cast spells through the subject of
the spell. However, the caster cannot read the subject’s
mind, nor does the caster find anything out
about the subject. There could be circumstances
where the caster does not even know where the subject
is. All that the caster becomes aware of is that
the spell is active, and from that point is also aware
of whatever the subject sees, hears, smells, tastes, or
touches until the duration of the spell ends.



Remove Curse
Page: 126
Cleric Level 3
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: Touch
Remove Curse instantaneously removes one curse on
a creature if it makes a saving throw versus Magic.
Remove Curse does not remove the curse from a
cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, although
the spell enables the creature afflicted with any such
cursed item to remove it from his person and get
rid of it. Remove Curse counters and dispels Bestow
Curse.

Bestow Curse (the reverse of Remove Curse) can
bring about any number of unfortunate effects
upon a being, determined by the caster and Referee.
Some limits of effect must be enforced. Typical
possibilities are limited to no more than a –2 penalty
to saving throws or –4 to hit, an ability being
reduced by 50%. These effects can have any number
of creative symptoms. The victim can avoid being
affected by Bestow Curse with a successful saving
throw versus Magic.



Remove Fear
Page: 126
Cleric Level 1
Duration: See Below
Range: Touch
This spells instills courage in the subject, and potentially
removes the effect of magic-induced fear by
allowing the target a saving throw versus Magic to
attempt to remove the effects. The subject receives a
saving throw bonus of +1 per level of the caster. The
subject automatically succeeds in any morale checks
for a number of Rounds equal to the caster’s level.
Remove Fear counters and dispels Cause Fear.
The reverse, Cause Fear, will cause a subject who
is touched to run away, hysterical, at full running
movement for a number of Rounds equal to the
caster’s level.



Resist Cold
Page: 126
Cleric Level 2
Duration: 1 Turn/level
Range: Touch
While under the effects of this spell, a character or
monster is unharmed by freezing (non-magical)
cold, and receives a bonus of +2 to all saving throws
versus cold-based magical or breath attacks. In addition,
1 point of damage is subtracted from each dice
of damage dealt by a cold-based attack. Each die will
still inflict a minimum of 1 point of damage.



Resist Fire
Page: 126
Cleric Level 2
Duration: 1 Turn/level
Range: Touch
While under the effects of this spell, a character
or monster is unharmed by intense (non-magical)
heat, and he receives a bonus of +3 to all saving
throws versus heat-based magical or breath attacks.
In addition, 1 point of damage is subtracted from
each die of damage dealt by a heat-based attack.
Each die will still inflict a minimum of 1 point of
damage.



Reverse Gravity
Page: 127
Magic-User Level 7
Duration: 1 Round
Range: 5'/level
Nature is a Magic-User’s plaything, and this spell
commands the earth to throw away people and
objects standing upon it. This affects a 30' squared
area, causing all unattached objects and creatures
within that area to “fall” upward 20'. If some solid
object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall,
falling objects and creatures strike it in the same
manner as they would during a normal downward
fall. If an object or creature reaches the maximum
height without striking anything, it remains there,
oscillating slightly, until the spell ends. At the end
of the spell duration, affected objects and creatures
fall downward, suffering the usual falling damage
when they hit the ground.



Sacrifice
Page: 127
Cleric Level 3
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: Touch
This spell allows the Cleric to transfer any desired
number of Hit Points from himself to the target. The
reverse of this spell, Drain Life, allows the caster to
drain 1d6+1 Hit Points from a creature, with a successful
attack roll. The Hit Points are transferred to
the cleric through healing.



Sanctuary
Page: 127
Cleric Level 1
Duration: 2 Rounds/level
Range: Touch
This spell allows the subject to be attacked less often
by foes. Any creature attempting to attack the subject
must first make a saving throw versus Magic,
or else it is not permitted to make an attack. The
attacker does not lose its turn; it can still attack
another target, move, or do anything else it is normally
allowed to do. This restriction applies to area
effect attacks as well, unless there is another target
within that area.
The spell ends immediately if the subject makes
any violent or offensive action.



Secret Chest
Page: 127
Magic-User Level 5
Duration: 60 days
Range: See Below
By casting this spell, a Magic-User can hide a chest
in another dimension for as long as sixty days and
can retrieve it at will. The chest can contain up to 1
cubic foot of material per caster level (regardless of
the chest’s actual size, which is about 3' by 2' by 2').
If any living creatures are placed in the chest, there
is a 75% chance that the spell simply fails. Once the
chest is hidden, the caster can retrieve it by concentrating
(a standard action), and it will appear next
to him.

See book for details.



Secret Page
Page: 128
Magic-User Level 3
Duration: Permanent
Range: Touch
This spell allows the caster to disguise a single page
in a book (or inscriptions on a tombstone, a framed
painting, or any sort of medium analogous to a
“page”) as something else.

The caster will see still the information as it truly
is, but all others looking upon it will see the illusory
information as determined by the caster.



Seven Gates
Page: 128
Magic-User Level 4
Duration: 4d6 Turns
Range: See Below
Seven pre-prepared gates (some marker must be
placed at the gate’s intended location) at a distance
of up to five miles from each other are activated,
allowing people to move between them. The first
gate appears in front of the caster. After entering a
gate, roll d8 to determine the exit point; a roll of
8 means the traveler has been temporarily caught
between dimensions and cannot get out for 1d6
Turns. At that point, he gets a saving throw each
additional Turn to emerge successfully at a random
gate—if the spell hasn’t ended by that time, of
course.



Shades
Page: 128
Magic-User Level 6
Duration: 1 Round/level
Range: 30'
The caster creates phantasmal pseudo-real monsters
in an area of 20'. The monster or monsters created
cannot exceed the caster’s level in Hit Dice. Monsters
created in this fashion must all be the same
type. They each have 5 hp per the creature’s normal
Hit Dice. Victims are allowed a saving throw versus
Magic to realize that the creatures are only partly
real. The phantasmal monsters are able to attack and
deal damage as per a normal creature of their type
to any being that fails this saving throw. If the saving
throw succeeds, the phantasmal monsters have an
effective AC 15 and only inflict half of their normal
damage.



Shadow Monsters
Page: 128
Magic-User Level 4
Duration: 1 Round/level
Range: 30'
The caster creates phantasmal pseudo-real monsters
in an area 20' square. The monster or monsters created
cannot exceed the caster’s level in Hit Dice.
Monsters created in this fashion must all be the
same type. They have 2 hp per the creature’s normal
Hit Dice. Victims are allowed a saving throw versus
Magic to realize that the creatures are only partly real.
The phantasmal monsters are able to attack and deal
damage as per a normal creature of their type to any
being that fails this saving throw. If the saving throw
succeeds, the phantasmal monsters have an effective
AC 12 and only a quarter of their normal damage.



Shape Change
Page: 128
Magic-User Level 9
Duration: 1 Turn/level
Range: 0
This spell enables the caster to assume the form of
any single non-unique creature (of any type) except
for particularly powerful creatures like demons,
devils, or demi-gods. The caster’s Hit Points remain
the same. The caster gains all of the extraordinary
and supernatural abilities (both attacks and qualities)
of the assumed form, except for any abilities
relying on the knowledge or intelligence of the
monster, because the caster’s mind remains his own.
The caster can change form once each Round for
the duration of the spell.



Shield
Page: 128
Magic-User Level 1
Duration: 2 Turns
Range: Touch
Magic-Users are masters of matter and as such can
command objects racing towards them to stop. The
objects are sometimes impertinent, it is true, but
this spell will protect the caster from many attacks
which would otherwise harm him. Against missile
attacks, the spell grants the caster AC 19, and
an effective AC 17 for all other attacks. Even if an
attack hits, it does one less point of damage than it
otherwise would have.



Silence 15' Radius
Page: 129
Cleric Level 2
Duration: 2 Rounds/level
Range: 120'
Upon the casting of this spell, complete silence prevails
in a diameter of 30'. All sound is stopped and
conversation is impossible. No noise whatsoever
issues from the area, but noise originating from outside
the silenced area can be heard by those within
it. The spell can be cast on a point in space, but the
effect is stationary unless cast on a mobile object.
The spell can be centered on a creature, and the
effect then radiates from the creature and moves as
it moves. An unwilling creature can attempt a saving
throw versus Magic, and if successful the spell takes
effect in a stationary location near the creature, but
the creature can move out of the affected area.



Simulacrum
Page: 129
Magic-User Level 7
Duration: Permanent
Range: Touch
Simulacrum creates a pseudo-duplicate of any
creature. The spell is cast over a rough snow or ice
form, and some piece of the creature to be duplicated
(hair, nail, or the like) must be placed inside
the snow or ice. The simulacrum appears to be the
same as the original, but it has only one-half of
the real creature’s Hit Points. The duplicate has a
faulty memory of the original’s life, but will remember
most details 30% of the time. At all times, the
simulacrum remains under the caster’s absolute
command. No special telepathic link exists, so command
must be exercised in some other manner. A
simulacrum has no ability to become more powerful.
It cannot increase its level or abilities. If
reduced to 0 Hit Points or otherwise destroyed, a
simulacrum reverts to snow and melts instantly into
nothingness. A simulacrum will radiate magic with
a Detect Magic spell, and True Seeing will reveal a
simulacrum’s true nature.



Sleep
Page: 129
Magic-User Level 1
Duration: d4 Turns
Range: 30' + 10'/level
A Sleep spell causes a magical slumber to come upon
creatures with 4+1 or fewer Hit Dice. The caster
can only affect 1 creature if it has 4+1 or more Hit
Dice, but the spell will otherwise affect creatures
totaling no more than 2d8 Hit Dice. Calculate
monsters with less than 1 Hit Die as having 1 Hit
Die, and monsters with a bonus to their Hit Dice as
having the flat amount. For example, a 3+2 Hit Die
monster would be calculated as having 3 Hit Dice.
Excess Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a
creature are wasted. Creatures with the fewest Hit
Dice are affected first. Slapping or wounding awakens
an affected creature, but normal noise does not.
Sleep does not affect undead, constructs, or other
magical or unnatural creatures (such as Elves).



Speak with Animals
Page: 129
Magic-User Level 2
Duration: 2 Rounds/level
Range: 0
The caster can comprehend and communicate
with ordinary animals or giant versions of ordinary
animals. The caster can ask questions of, and
receive answers from, one particular kind of animal,
although the spell does not make it any more
friendly or cooperative than normal. The type of
animal is decided when the spell is cast. If an animal
is friendly toward the caster, it may do him some
favor or service.



Speak with Dead
Page: 130
Magic-User Level 3
Duration: See Below
Range: 10'
This spell rips the spirit of a corpse from the
afterlife and returns it to its body. The habitation
is imperfect, and as such the spirit is only able to
move the body’s lips and tongue, and thus is able
to answer questions.
The corpse’s knowledge is limited to what the
person knew during life, including the languages it
spoke (if any). Answers are often brief, cryptic, or
repetitive.

See book for details.



Speak with Monsters
Page: 130
Magic-User Level 6
Duration: 1 Round/level
Range: 30'
The caster can comprehend and communicate with
any creature. The caster can ask questions of, and
receive answers from, one particular kind of monster,
although the spell does not make it any more
friendly or cooperative than normal. If a creature is
friendly toward the caster, it may do him some favor
or service.



Speak with Plants
Page: 130
Magic-User Level 4
Duration: 1 Round/level
Range: 0
The caster can communicate with plants, including
both normal plants and plant creatures. The caster
is able to ask questions of and receive answers from
plants, and can ask plants to move in such a way to
clear a path that is otherwise impassable or covered
in difficult growth. The spell does not make plant
creatures any more friendly or cooperative than
normal. If a plant creature is friendly toward the
caster, it may do him some favor or service.



Spell Immunity
Page: 131
Cleric Level 4
Duration: 1 Turn/level
Range: Touch
The caster can use this spell to grant resistance
to all spells and spell-like abilities, improving his
chance to make saves versus Magic. Spells that
Charm, Command, Cause Fear, and similar effects
are granted a saving throw bonus of +8. Extremely
powerful compulsive spells such as Geas are granted
a bonus to a saving throw of +5. All other spells are
granted a +3 saving throw bonus. The caster can
affect 1 creature for the spell's duration, per level, or
multiple creatures with the duration divided among
them.



Spell Turning
Page: 131
Magic-User Level 7
Duration: 1 Round/level
Range: 0
Spells and spell-like effects targeted on the caster
are turned back upon the original caster. The spell
turns only effects that have the caster as a singular
target. Area effect spells are not affected. Spell Turning
also fails to stop touch range spells.
When a spell is turned, the original caster
receives a saving throw if the spell normally calls
for one.



Spider Climb
Page: 131
Magic-User Level 1
Duration: 1 Round + 1 Round/level
Range: Touch
The subject can climb and travel on vertical surfaces
or even traverse ceilings as a spider does. The
affected creature must have its hands and feet free
to climb in this manner. Any objects weighing less
than 5 pounds cling to the spell recipient’s hands
and feet. This spell can be used on another being
(touch required) with no saving throw.



Statue
Page: 131
Magic-User Level 7
Duration: 6 Turns/level
Range: Touch
A Statue spell turns the caster or a subject to solid
stone, along with any garments and equipment
worn or carried. The subject can see, hear, and smell
normally, but it does not need to eat or breathe.
Feeling is limited to those sensations that can affect
the granite-hard substance of the individual’s body.
Chipping is equal to a mere scratch, but breaking off
one of the statue’s arms constitutes serious damage.
The subject of a Statue spell can return to its normal
state, act, and then return instantly to the statue
state if it so desires, as long as the spell duration is
in effect.



Stinking Cloud
Page: 131
Magic-User Level 2
Duration: 1 Round/level
Range: 30'
Stinking Cloud creates a 20' cubed bank of fog
centered anywhere within range, making living
creatures within it helpless with nausea. This condition
lasts as long as a creature is in the cloud and for
1d4+1 Rounds after it leaves. Any creature that succeeds
in a saving throw versus Poison when leaving
the fog is not affected for the additional Rounds.



Stone Shape
Page: 131
Magic-User Level 5
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: Touch
This spell can form an existing piece of stone into
any shape that suits the caster’s purpose, to a total
volume of 1' cubed per level. While it is possible to
make crude coffers, doors, and so forth with stone
shape, fine detail is not possible.



Stone to Flesh
Page: 131
Magic-User Level 6
Duration: Permanent
Range: 120'
This spell returns a petrified creature to its normal
state, restoring both life and goods. Any petrified
creature, regardless of size, can be restored.
Flesh to Stone (the reverse of Stone to Flesh) turns
one creature into a statue, including all gear and any
items currently held. A saving
throw versus Paralyzation
is permitted to resist the
transformation.



Strange Waters II
Page: 132
Magic-User Level 3
Duration: See Below
Range: 10'
This spell creates a small sphere of water, filled with
twenty small fish, in the air which immediately
crashes to the ground. The fish immediately begin
suffocating, and will all die in one Turn. If a fish is
eaten before it dies, it delivers a magical effect to
the one eating it. 

See book for details.



Suggestion
Page: 133
Magic-User Level 3
Duration: Permanent until Triggered
Range: 30'
The Magic-User is an expert in tricking the nether
forces into revealing its secrets, and thus magic
use was born. Fooling common humans is nothing
compared to this. Suggestion is one of the few
spells that is cast surreptitiously during an ongoing
conversation, and only Magic-Users and Elves will
recognize what is happening. After the spell is cast,
and if the victim fails a saving throw versus Magic,
the caster can implant a suggestion in the mind of
one listener. This suggestion will lie buried in the
victim's mind until a trigger event, set by the caster,
occurs. Then the victim will carry out the suggested
action. A more subtle suggestion not having to do
with specific actions (for example, suggesting that a
certain person or group is evil or undesirable) will
instead affect the victim's attitudes, but after every
time that the victim behaves in a manner contrary
to his regular nature he receives an additional
saving throw versus Magic to shake off the effects
of the spell.

See book for details.



Suggestion, Mass
Page: 133
Magic-User Level 6
Duration: Permanent until Triggered
Range: 10'/level
As a Magic-User becomes more comfortable (never
completely comfortable, just more than before) in
manipulating the forces of magic, he also becomes
more proficient in warping the hearts and minds of
those around him. Mass Suggestion is one of the few
spells that is cast surreptitiously, during an ongoing
conversation, and only Magic-Users and Elves
will recognize what is happening. 

See book for details.



Summon
Page: 134
Magic-User Level 1
Duration: See Below
Range: 10'
Magic fundamentally works by ripping a hole in
the fabric of space and time and pulling out energy
that interacts with and warps our reality. Various
mages have managed to consistently capture specific
energy in exact amounts to produce replicable
results: Spells.

The Summon spell opens the rift between the
worlds a little bit more and forces an inhabitant
From Beyond into our world to do the Magic-User's
bidding. What exactly comes through the tear,
and whether or not it will do what the summoner
wishes, is wholly unpredictable.

Once the Summon spell is cast, there are a
number of steps to resolve

See book for details.



Symbol
Page: 144
Magic-User Level 8
Duration: Permanent until Triggered
Range: Touch
This spell allows the caster to scribe a potent rune
of power upon a surface. There are eight different
Symbols, each with a different effect. Symbols are
triggered by being read, touched, or if a creature
passes through a door with a Symbol inscribed on
it. The only way a Symbol can be identified is by
reading it, which triggers the effects. 

See book for details.



Telekinesis
Page: 144
Magic-User Level 5
Duration: 1 Round/level
Range: 120'
By concentrating on nothing else and taking no
other actions, the caster can move objects or
creatures by concentrating on them. A total of
20 pounds per caster level can be moved 20' per
Round. Living beings can also be moved, but they
are allowed a saving throw versus Magic to resist
being moved by the spell.



Teleport
Page: 144
Magic-User Level 5
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: Touch
This spell fixes the caster in one absolutely point in
space, and moves creation so that the caster appears
to instantly travel an incredible distance. The caster
chooses where he wishes to go, which can be as
distant as 100 miles per caster level. The caster can
bring along objects or creatures, not to exceed 300
pounds plus 100 pounds per level above 10th. The
caster must be in contact with all objects and/or
creatures to be transported (although creatures to
be transported can be in contact with one another,
with at least one of those creatures in contact with
the caster). Unwilling creatures are allowed a saving
throw versus Magic to resist, and the caster may
need to make an attack roll to make contact with
such a creature. Likewise, a creature’s save versus
Magic prevents items in its possession from being
teleported.

See book for details.



Temporal Stasis
Page: 145
Magic-User Level 9
Duration: Permanent
Range: Touch
The subject is placed into a state of suspended animation.
For the character so afflicted, time ceases
to flow. The character does not grow older, and his
body functions virtually cease. This state persists
until the magic is removed (such as with Dispel
Magic spell). No saving throw is permitted.



Time Stop
Page: 145
Magic-User Level 9
Duration: See Below
Range: 0
This spell brings all of creation (and anti-creation)
to a complete halt, while allowing the caster the
freedom to act in this inert universe. Because existence
wants to be active, this spell cannot last long.
The caster can take 1d4+2 Rounds worth of actions
(the exact amount rolled by the Referee in secret)
instantly, as the caster acts within the folds of adjacent
moments.



Tongues
Page: 146
Cleric Level 6
Duration: Permanent
Range: 0
This spell allows the Cleric to communicate with one
specific being. This does not give the Cleric the ability
to speak different languages, nor does it give the
other being the ability to speak any specific language,
but the Cleric and this being will understand each
other. If for some reason the target of the spell does
not wish this communication, it is allowed a saving
throw versus Magic to avoid the spell’s effect.
The reverse of this spell, Babble, curses one victim
to never again understand or be understood by his
fellow beings. The Cleric must touch the victim,
who receives a saving throw versus Magic to avoid
the spell’s effect.



Transmute Rock to Mud
Page: 146
Magic-User Level 5
Duration: Permanent
Range: 120'
This spell turns 3,000 square feet of rock 10' deep into
mud for 3d6 days. Any beings passing through the
mud have their movement reduced by 90%. Transmute
Mud to Rock (the reverse of Transmute Rock to
Mud) changes an equal volume of mud described
above into rock. This alteration is permanent unless
the reverse spell is cast on the altered mud or rock.



Trap the Soul
Page: 146
Magic-User Level 8
Duration: Permanent
Range: 10'
Trap the Soul forces a creature’s life force (and material
body) into a gem. The gem holds the trapped
entity indefinitely or until the gem is broken and
the life force is released, allowing the material body
to reform. Before the actual casting of Trap the Soul,
the caster must procure a gem of at least 1,000 sp
value for every Hit Die possessed by the creature
to be trapped. The spell can be triggered in one of
two ways.

See book for details.



True Seeing
Page: 146
Cleric Level 5
Duration: 1 Round/level
Range: Touch
The caster confers on a subject the ability to ignore
all of the lies told to us by our natural eyes and to
see all things as they actually are. The subject sees
through normal and magical darkness, notices
secret doors, sees invisible creatures or objects normally,
sees through illusions, and sees the true form
of polymorphed, changed, or transmuted things.
False Seeing, (the reverse of True Seeing), makes
objects, characters, and monsters appear as their
“opposite.” The ugly appears beautiful, the valuable
appears worthless, and so on.



Turn Undead
Page: 146
Cleric Level 1
Duration: 1d4+2 Turns
Range: 120'
One true measure of divine power is the command
over life and death. In particular, power over
the walking dead. They are abominations, a crime
against creation. One of a Cleric’s first duties is to
ensure that the dead shall dead remain. And so they
have the power to first ward against, and later outright
destroy, these creations.

See book for details.



Unseen Servant
Page: 148
Magic-User Level 1
Duration: 6 Turns +1 Turn/level
Range: 0
An Unseen Servant is an invisible, mindless, shapeless
force that performs simple tasks at the caster’s
command. It can run and fetch things, open unstuck
doors, and hold chairs, as well as clean and mend.
It can open only normal doors, drawers, lids, and
the like. It can lift 20 pounds or drag 40 pounds.
The Servant cannot attack in any way, and it cannot
be killed because it is a magical force, not a living
thing.



Vanish
Page: 148
Magic-User Level 7
Duration: Permanent
Range: Touch
By casting this spell, a Magic-User can teleport an
object as per the spell Teleport, or even banish the
object to the spirit plane, in which case the object is
replaced in the material plane with small stone that
matches the object’s shape. A total of 50 pounds
per level, not to exceed a volume of 3' cubed per
level, can be caused to vanish in this manner. If
the spell Dispel Magic is cast upon the stone item
that replaced the object of the Vanish spell, it might
bring back the original item.



Veil
Page: 148
Magic-User Level 6
Duration: 1 Turn/level
Range: 10'/level
The caster instantly changes the appearance of a
20' square area, including creatures in it if desired.
The illusion is maintained for the spell’s duration.
The caster can make the subjects appear to appear
as anything he that he wants them to. They look,
feel, and smell just like the creatures the spell makes
them resemble, or the area looks, feels and smells
like a different area as desired. Affected creatures
resume their normal appearances if slain. This spell
can also be used to mimic the effects of Hallucinatory
Terrain, but the illusion does hold up even
under physical inspection. The spell True Seeing or
similar magical effects will reveal the illusion for
what it is.



Vision
Page: 148
Magic-User Level 7
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: 0
This spell calls upon the greater Powers of the universe
to impart knowledge unto the caster. The
caster must have a specific question in mind when
casting, and if the spell is successful, the caster falls
into a hallucinogenic daze as the information floods
his mind.

See book for details.



Wall of Fire
Page: 148
Magic-User Level 4
Duration: 1 Round/level
Range: 80' or 0
This spell calls up a blazing inferno of flame in the
shape of a wall. One side of the conflagration emits
the searing heat that one would expect, but the
other side merely emits a gentle warmth. Passing
through the flames inflicts 2d6 damage. Creatures
as far as ten feet from the hot side of the wall suffer
1d6 points of damage. Undead creatures suffer
worse, taking twice the ordinary damage that the
wall would inflict. The wall persists for as long
as the caster concentrates upon it, or, if concentration
is not maintained, will remain for 1 Round
per caster level. The caster can evoke a wall of fire
in one of two shapes, a wall or a ring. The size of a
straight wall is up to 20' square per caster level. A
ring has a radius of up to five feet per caster level
(with the caster in the center) and is 20' high. If
the caster manifests the spell as a wall, the effect
is stationary. The ring-shaped wall moves with the
caster.



Wall of Fog
Page: 149
Magic-User Level 2
Duration: 5 Rounds +1 Round/level
Range: 30'
The caster of this spell creates an opaque, fog-like
vapor in a 20' cube area per caster level. All beings
caught within the vapor cannot see beyond 2'.
Strong winds of natural or magical origin can dissipate
the Wall of Fog before its duration has expired.



Wall of Force
Page: 149
Magic-User Level 5
Duration: 1 Turn
Range: 30'
This spell creates an airtight invisible wall of able to
resist most attacks. The wall cannot move after the
spell is cast, and it is immune to damage of all kinds,
including most spells. Even Dispel Magic will not
bring the wall down, but Disintegrate immediately
destroys it. Breath weapons, spells, mêlée and missile
attacks, electrical attacks, and thermal attacks
cannot pass through the wall in either direction,
and of course physical movement is likewise curtailed.
The caster can form the wall into any shape
which has an area up to one 20' square per level of
the caster.



Wall of Ice
Page: 149
Magic-User Level 4
Duration: 12 Turns
Range: 120'
An immobile, translucent, wall of ice springs into
existence for the duration of the spell. The wall can
be as large as 1,200 square feet, and can be shaped
in any manner and to any dimensions the caster
desires, so that it can be a straight wall or curved
into a protective circle. This wall of ice is impenetrable
to monsters with less than 4 Hit Dice. Monsters
with more than 4 Hit Dice suffer 1d6 points of
damage when they break through the wall. The wall
deals double damage to creatures that use fire or are
accustomed to hot conditions. The wall cannot be
evoked so that it appears where objects are, and it
must rest on a solid surface.



Wall of Iron
Page: 149
Magic-User Level 5
Duration: Permanent
Range: 120'
With this spell the caster can cause a flat, vertical
iron wall to spring into being. The wall inserts itself
into any surrounding nonliving material if its area
is sufficient to do so. The wall cannot be conjured
so that it occupies the same space as a creature or
another object. It must always be a flat plane. If not
supported, the wall has a 50% chance of falling in
either direction, smashing any creatures under it. A
wall of iron is ¼" thick per caster level. Total area
can be 15' square per caster level, and the area can
be doubled if the thickness is halved. Like any iron
wall, this wall is subject to rust, perforation, and
other natural phenomena.



Wall of Stone
Page: 149
Magic-User Level 5
Duration: Permanent
Range: 120'
The caster brings a stone wall into being that can be
any form that the caster desires, to a maximum of
1,000 cubic feet. This wall is permanent unless otherwise
destroyed or a Dispel Magic spell is cast upon
it. The wall cannot be evoked so that it occupies the
same space as a creature or another object, and it
must rest on a solid surface.



Water Breathing*
Page: 150
Magic-User Level 3
Duration: 6 Turns/level
Range: Touch
The subject of this spell grows gills in his neck, his
skin takes on a scaly texture, and he gains the ability
breathe water freely for the duration of the spell.
Creatures under the influence of the spell are not
granted any additional proficiency at swimming. Air
Breathing (the reverse of Water Breathing) allows
sea creatures to breathe air, but unless they already
possess a means to move around on land, it does not
grant them the ability to do so.



Water Walk
Page: 150
Cleric Level 3
Duration: 1 Turn/level
Range: Touch
The subject of this spell is granted divine favor,
allowing him to walk on water, or any kind of liquid,
as if it were dry land. However, liquid is similarly
impenetrable to the subject as normal ground, so
it would be impossible to reach into a pool of water
to grab anything, for example. If the liquid is dangerous
(lava, acid), the subject is still subject to
negative effects of the substance. The subject can
end the spell at any time.



Web
Page: 150
Magic-User Level 2
Duration: 2 Turns/level
Range: 5'/level
This spell causes a large volume of sticky, disgusting
strands of goo to shoot forth from the caster’s
mouth into an area approximately 20 feet square.
Creatures caught within the web become entangled
among the gluey fibers. Entangled creatures cannot
move, but can break loose depending on their
Strength. Any being with Strength in a human range
can break free of the webs in 2d4 Turns. Creatures
of higher Strength or magically augmented Strength
above 18 can break free in 4 Rounds. Creatures
larger than ogre size can rip through the web at will.
The strands of a Web spell are flammable. All creatures
within flaming webs take 1d6 points of fire
damage from the flames for 2 Rounds. After this
time, all surviving creatures are free of the webs.

Wizard Eye
Page: 152
Magic-User Level 4
Duration: 1 Turn/level
Range: 0
The caster creates an invisible
magical sensor that sends visual
information, and can see with
60' dark vision. The arcane eye travels up
to 120' each Turn. The eye can travel in any
direction as long as the spell lasts. Solid
barriers block its passage, but it can pass
through a hole or space as small as 1 inch
in diameter.



Wizard Lock
Page: 152
Magic-User Level 2
Duration: Permanent
Range: Touch
Some doors are never meant to be opened.
This spell magically holds shut a door, gate,
window, or shutter of wood, metal, or stone.
The magic affects the portal just as if it were
securely closed and normally locked. A
Knock spell or Dispel Magic spell can negate
a Wizard Lock spell, but the Wizard Lock
will take effect when a portal opened with a
Knock is closed again.



Word of Recall
Page: 152
Cleric Level 6
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: 0
The casting of this spell summons the very
essence of his deity to protect him, and this
divine force removes the caster from his
current location and delivers him instantly to 
his sanctuary. The caster must designate the 
sanctuary when preparing the spell, and it must 
be a very familiar place. Any distance can be 
traveled with no chance of error. In addition 
to himself, the caster can transport an 
additional 25 pounds per level of experience.
